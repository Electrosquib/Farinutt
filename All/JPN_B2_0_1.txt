I agree with this. My main reason for agreeing is because smoking is really bad for oneâs health. I have heard that it's poisonous to breathe somebody's smoke. I mean if someone smokes in front of a non-smoker, the non-smoker could be affected sometimes more than the smoker. Some restaurants separate the seats for non-smokers, but the smoke could still reach to non-smokers. In the restaurant, we should enjoy the dishes without smoke. In many countries, smoking in restaurants is not allowed. Japan is too oblivious to the smoking problem. There are no good points to smoking. We have to think about this more seriously. Me, I don't smoke and I really hate smoking. But actually I have many friends who smoke. I can't tell them to stop smoking, although I am worried about their health, as I also know how hard it is to stop smoking and they want to stop if they can. One of my friends who often smokes said that she doesn't know how to stop smoking so she wants some non-poisonous substitute. I don't think smoking should be banned completely everywhere so far because it would be so hard for smokers, but I hope some kind of substitute will be made as she said. What I want to say is that smoking should be banned at least in the restaurants, but not everywhere. We should think not only for non-smokers but also for smokers.﻿I agree with the statement. First of all, I really hate smell of smoke. The smell is very strong and it does not go away until I take a bath and take off my clothes. It is very uncomfortable. Once the smell sticks with me, I have to be with it all day. I can't believe it. Second of all, restaurants are public places. Everyone is in there, including babies and old people who can't protect their bodies strongly. Public places should be safe. Besides, people usually have a good time with family or friends having a delicious meal and enjoying their conversations in a restaurant. Nobody can interrupt their leisure time. Smokers should put up with not smoking in restaurants, because their visit only lasts an hour or more. Last of all, smoking is nothing but poison for smokers and people around smokers. It is so harmful that it causes lung cancer. Now everyone knows it. It is like a crime to smoke in public places; it hurts people, even though the bad effect is invisible at that time. But it is certain that smoking destroys our health, so it is natural that smoking should be banned in public places.﻿I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country in terms of the health of the customers and the benefit of the restaurants. First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in the non-smoking area end up receiving the secondhand smoke. It is said that the secondhand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than firsthand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harms customers in both physical and mental ways. Second, smoking does harm to the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed, whether completely or partially. In fact, when I choose a restaurant, I try not to go to restaurants that do not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friends and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers fewer customers than if it banned smoking. This is detrimental to the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely.﻿I agree with this statement because smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants. I'll talk about why smoking is bad for other customers. It's bad for health and enjoying food. As it is known widely, smoking is worse for secondary receivers of its smoke than for smokers themselves. There are many people affected by secondhand smoke, including, of course, children. To avoid the health problem of non-smokers and children, smoking should be banned. In addition, it's bad for eating food. In my case, I cannot enjoy eating if others smoke. I have a terrible headache when I smell smoke. How can I enjoy the food? Even if the smoking zone is separated, I can smell smoke when I go to the bathroom or something like a drink-bar. Then, as I said, I get a headache. It's a good idea to have a separate smoking zone, but it's best to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. And next, I'll tell you why it's bad for restaurants. When I see people who smoke in the restaurant, I always wonder if they enjoy the food. I think they don't. Smells and tastes are diminished by smoking. A restaurant is a place where we enjoy eating and restaurants must think they want customers to enjoy the taste of their food. If restaurants really think this way, they must ban smoking to let customers enjoy their delicious food. Smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants, so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, smoking should not be banned completely for two reasons. First, a smoker has a right to smoke as long as it doesn't become a nuisance to other members of the public. In the restaurant, if they make some area or tables for smokers, smoking will not trouble other people. In some public place where we can't separate non-smokers from smokers such as sidewalks in a big city or platforms at station during rush hour, I think, of course, we should ban smoking completely. But if we just set the table for smokers, there could be no problem. Actually, at many restaurants they arrange tables for both groups (smokers and non-smokers), and this is considered to be a good idea and seems to have been successful. Second, if smoking were banned completely at all restaurants, smokers would hesitate to go to restaurants. In this situation, the profit of restaurants would decrease and eventually the economy would also be negatively impacted. It is true that the number of smokers is decreasing, but there are still large numbers of people who enjoy smoking. I have a friend who smokes very often. He said that he didn't want to go to a restaurant in which smoking is banned. So, if we shut out those people from restaurants or cafés, there would be a negative impact on the Japanese economy. As I said above, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.
﻿I agree with this idea, mainly because there are many people who don't like smoking. Especially at restaurants, people who don't smoke may think that they want to taste their dishes without being impacted by smoke. Moreover, nowadays the number of people who don't smoke is increasing in Japan. In other words, the number of people who don't want to take their seats near smokers in restaurants is growing. Therefore, restaurants that do not ban smoking may lose their customers who don't smoke. For example, if there are two restaurants, one in which smoking is completely banned to smoke and the other in which smoking is permitted, I will choose the one that completely bans smoking because I hate smoke in restaurants. People who love smoking should go to cigar bars, not to restaurants. Both restaurants and bars can continue to attract their customers. In addition, I think that making smoking and non-smoking areas costs restaurants a lot of money. They must prepare some equipment to divide the two areas and the clerks must spend their time to do so and to ask their customers which area they prefer. To ban smoking is good for both customers and restaurants.﻿I agree with this statement. I have two reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, to ban smoking at all restaurants, people who do not smoke can be guarded from smoke-filled air. Recently in Japan, more and more restaurants have separate smoking and non-smoking sections, and at most restaurants, you can choose the section where you sit. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, there is still high possibility for non-smokers to breathe smoke. For example, non-smokers cannot choose a non-smoking seat if the section is full. In this case, they have to take seats in the smoking section, and they automatically breathe smoke. Also, just separating the sections cannot completely prevent non-smokers from breathing smoke. Even if smoking and non-smoking sections are separate, the two of them are still in the same restaurant. Thus, non-smokers are not perfectly guarded from smoke-filled air. In addition, clerks should also be considered. Even if there are separate smoking and non-smoking sections in a restaurant, it does not help the clerks. Therefore, the clerks cannot be guarded from smoke. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants helps smokers to try to stop smoking. If smoking is not accepted at restaurants, smokers cannot smoke at restaurants. I think it makes smokers think about trying to stop smoking. It is very good for their health to stop smoking. For these two reasons, I agree with this statement.﻿I disagree with the statement. There is a prevailing opinion that since a restaurant is a place to eat, it shouldn't be covered with cigarette smoke, in order not to spoil the food. This opinion sounds valid, but who in the world made a rule that foods should always be eaten in clean places? Actually, this opinion is held by people who do not smoke, who are in the majority. How about the opinions of people who want to smoke while eating? Also, from the point of view of diversity, I think there can be some people who smoke. A world where everyone is behaving the same will just be boring. People smoking look somewhat cool. There's also an opinion referring to the bad effects smoking causes to your health, but I think just a few minutes being exposed to smoke while you eat won't give you a fatal effect, unless you go and eat at restaurants about twenty times a week. But for my real opinion, I don't really care whether people smoke at restaurants or not, because I don't go to restaurants so often. Many people must be the same. There are many cooking books you can buy at bookstores, and you can make meals tasty enough by yourself.﻿I agree with the statement because of the following reasons. First, when we breathe the smoke, we sometimes cough or develop a sore throat. That is a bad thing for us. Second, the smell of smoke is very bad. Some people may think that everyone should tolerate the smell, because smoking gives smokers refreshment like a drink makes people refreshed. So, they think smoking in restaurants is not a bad thing. However, there is a serious problem in smoking: cigarette smoke contains many harmful products like nicotine. Such products are said to cause cancer. Moreover, they harm not only smokers but also people near them. Smoking gives us not so much refreshment as illness. In Japan, smoking seats are separated from non-smoking seats in many restaurants, but they are not completely separated. When we sit in the non-smoking seats, smoke comes into the area and we breathe in harmful substances. That makes no means to separate the seats. Japanese restaurants sometimes have enough space, so I think it difficult to separate them completely. If smoking were banned in every restaurant, we would have no trouble with smoking. So, stores like restaurants should ban smoking.﻿I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm going to write why I think this way by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the situation. Now, imagine that all the restaurants in the country ban smoking. As many of you know, smoking gives us nothing good, especially when it came to medical field. Tobacco smoke contains a lot of chemicals and some of them cause lung cancer. In addition, it has turned out that the smoke does more harm to those who are around the smoker than it does to the smoker himself. Therefore, if there's nobody to smoke in a restaurant, it means that nobody is exposed to the danger of taking the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. I think this is an advantage of banning smoking in restaurants. Some people might want to smoke, even in restaurants. Those people might not come to restaurants as they used to do, since they are never allowed to smoke in the restaurants. Decreasing the number of the customers can affect the financial state of restaurants, and have a negative economic influence. This is a disadvantage of banning smoking in restaurants. It is true that some people can feel that they cannot do without cigarettes. However, I think such people are already addicted to smoking. What they should do is not smoke in a restaurant and risk the health of both other people's and theirs; they should consult their doctor. In the first place, restaurant should be a place where people enjoy their meals. Therefore, I think banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is really a good idea.
