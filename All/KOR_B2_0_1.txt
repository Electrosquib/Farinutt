I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. While it is true that college tuition fees are high these days, scholarships and loans are being offered, too. I believe that this discussion has to take into account the idea of 'opportunity cost'. Take, for example, the case of a student who is deciding whether or not to work to support his studies or to spend more time studying to obtain a better result. The student has the option of working harder and spending more time studying to obtain a scholarship for his studies. The scholarship could solve the student's financial problems in addition to getting excellent results. I believe that this is an issue of investment of time. Students who do part time jobs are generally tired when they attend classes. This could affect their studies indirectly. A person could choose, instead, to invest his or her time on studies while applying for a loan to support their tuition fees. Being able to pay their tuition fees by working part time and being tired or sleepy in classes is not a good option. By doing the comparison, spending more time on studies, thus getting better results, and obtaining a scholarship is a better one. In conclusion, the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job should be discarded as it is not a viable alternative of solving a person's financial constraint problems. It is not wise for a student to forgo his studies to support his or her school tuition fees.﻿I think that college students should have a part-time job before graduating from university, because if they donft have any experience of a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a freshman, I worked for Lotto Riau as a part-time worker for one year. My parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and earn a little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than if I didn't have it. There was a bad aspect. It meant I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought about whether I would stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young, so I had many chances in the future and I had to go to the army. Now I don't regret it. If I was a freshman, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is a well-spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be more successful than someone with no experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.﻿Lots of problems exist in part-time jobs. I would like to discuss low wages, behavior of superiors, and the absence of break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea, and when I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress. When I was at work the manager treated me badly. He swore at me and shouted at me in front of people. At work, break time was not guaranteed. If the manager saw me moving slowly he would tell me to walk faster or to run. Of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid on time. Regarding the behavior of managers or superiors at work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case, as I said, the manager used to swear at part-time staff. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible, because part-time workers are people, too. They do not deserve that kind of treatment. My opinion is that the relationship between part-time workers and superiors should be improved for good. The second problem is that break time is not guaranteed. Humans require food, sleep, etc. to live, but at the part-time job employers want workers to work until their shift is done. That might increase profits, but it is a good way to lose people.﻿A part-time job is a way to look for my future job. We can also experience many jobs through part-time jobs. It is very important to experience other jobs because we don't know that what we are interested in and what we want to be. For these reasons, I think it is a very good way to gain experience. I have had several part-time jobs. They were very hard experiences, but it was a great time for me. When I needed money I sold clothes last year. I worked in a department store. It was very hard and I really wanted quit right away, but I needed money to travel abroad so I couldn't do that. When I was 21, I worked at a theater. It was a very interesting time, but I stressed about money. Because I checked money and calculated money accurately, the theater earned money. I also worked at a buffet restaurant. The work was very hard but eating delicious food was very good. Sometimes people gave me tips, so I thought it was a cool job. A few months ago, I taught middle school students. It was hard work too, because middle school students did not listen to my lessons. I think that the many jobs that I have experienced are going to be good sources in my future. Someday, you can experience many part-time jobs too.﻿I agree with the statement. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to gain experience before getting a job. For example, if students who have finished university get a job and have to work hard, they cannot work effectively because they have not enough experience. In university, no one teaches executive abilities. Second, lots of Korean students do not know the value of money since lots of Korean university students get pocket money from their parents. I think people who have never experienced part-time jobs do not know the value of money. Third, having a part-time job allows students to know about spending money. I think a lot of students do not have experience working in a part-time job and they do not know how to manage spending money because they have never experienced working and earning the money themselves. Because of this, it is a good experience for a university student to work in a part time job. The last thing is that they can get to know lots of people. If students work part-time jobs, they can get to know a lot of workers other than general university students. In Korea, it is important to know the people who are in the same field. Consequentially, I agree with working part-time jobs for university students.﻿Most college students get a part-time job during their school days. Needless to say, lots of students try to get a job in summer or winter vacation, all because they have to make a living for themselves. They say that college registration fees are expensive, and I agree. It's hard to imagine our parents paying all that money. That's why we need part time jobs, Although some do it because they do need money, I say part time jobs are good experience for all of us. But they can be bad if the students try to make part time jobs their ongoing jobs. Some don't go to school at all because of this approach. Anyway, even with all their hard effort trying to earn, the regular wage rules are not being kept. My friend was working in an internet cafe for 3000 won an hour. It's not fair. How can he make a living out of it? The hourly rate should be increased or people should observe the rules. I intend to get a part time job in the summer, but I don't want to work under these circumstances. But I need money, which means that I have no choice. I wish this could all somehow change for all of us.﻿I'm also a current college student and I agree, the students who work even just a small part-time job at school are more motivated to get work done. Now, some students do live off of their own parents' money, which is fine if they are that fortunate. However, if they don't have a need to work, these students should be involved in a club or some type of other activity. There's a lot of responsibility that goes into running an organization on campus and it can help students remained grounded in a similar way that a regular, paying job would. Ultimately, anything that keeps students from becoming lazy is a good thing. Holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. Students will enjoy their work, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on their studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success: time management. If students keep their priorities straight and find a part-time job that is at least tolerable, students will be adding an important element to their future resume.﻿I am going to write as a college student. First of all, yes, I agree with the statement. Doing a part time job is essential for students, and especially college students. It costs a lot to go to the university. Most college students lack both time and money in Korea. Of course it's important to earn money but all of the universities require too much money. Most students can't afford the money by themselves. Me either. I think we should go abroad or experience many things we haven't done instead of studying all day or working every day and staying at home. I insist it is important to do a part time job, but I hate how we have to do a part-time job. Anyway, we can learn many things from doing part time jobs, such as endurance, responsibility and conversation skills. I think these are much more important than the money we earn from doing part-time jobs. We can also learn how to use our time efficiently. To be at work on time, we schedule. That is how we learn to use our time. In addition, typically it's boring to do a part-time job, so I do some exercise or read a newspaper when I am free at work. You don't? But I do!﻿One year ago, I had a part-time job as a cashier. While working as a cashier, I felt several disciplines. At the time, I spent money on clothes, accessories, and rings. I didn't know the value of money, but I worked myself so I regretted my spending. I knew that my parents did hard work. And I felt like studying. While working, I wanted to study. Studying is very easy work. I knew that I disliked physical work. I wanted to work in the field of knowledge. So, I always wrote my income and expenses. When I got some pocket money, I didn't spend it. I saved everything in my savings account, and I really studied hard to gain knowledge. Part-time work is a very valuable experience. If I had not worked my part-time job, I would not have realized the value of money and the value of studying. It improves my mental quality. I think that people must work in part-time jobs at a young age. These days I get high English marks and am a good student. I must not forget my part-time job. My experience is so informative and helpful. I want to work another job so I want to learn another value. My children suggest that part-time work is a very good experience.﻿During your college days, you don't want to waste time but usually many students regret that you squander your time. But I think there are some ways not to waste your time while you study at university. The one of them is to have a part-time job. In fact, many students have part-time jobs, such as waiter, cashier, sales clerk, etc. during their college days to earn money and to gain experience. It is very helpful and very important for students to get a job, even though they don't have to get a part-time job to earn money. I will explain to you that why it is important. First, you can meet various people. Of course, you can meet people at your school but there is a difference between people whom you would meet at your workplace and people whom you would meet at your school. I think talking with various people gives you a lot of ideas. Also, you could have a chance to get information which you want to get. If you do a part-time job that is related to your future work, you can meet some people who have some information you need. It is more advantageous than other people who don't have a part-time job. Second, you earn money having a part-time job, so you can realize how important money is and how to spend money. You could develop a habit of saving money because you don't want to waste the money you earned. Some students waste money, but most students don't waste the money they earned themselves. Thus I think during your college days, doing a part-time job is very helpful, valuable, and worthwhile thing. I recommend you to do a part-time job while you are in university.
