I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because restaurants are places where people eat and most of the time, restaurants are closed areas. Smoking in closed areas would cause passive smokers to inhale as much pollutants as an active smoker. This would cause many health complications to a person. There are so many adverse effects of smoking. The smoke released could also mean that the pollutant particles from the smoke could end up on the food in the restaurant. This is especially unhealthy for the person who consumes the food. It is all the more unhealthy for a person to eat in a confined area, especially in restaurants. Another question which arises is "why is it that people should smoke while eating?" Restaurants are meant to be places where people eat. If there should be a place for people who want to smoke, it must be in a special room for people to smoke and not in restaurants. Smoking should never be allowed in restaurants. Restaurants are places for people to eat and not smoke. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is very unsightly for a restaurant to have people smoking in it.﻿I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. A few years ago, smoking was not important to all of us. But now, people's thinking has changed. Comedian Lee Jug-el died of lung cancer. To this day, I can't forget about what he said to the public about smoking. He was as smoker for many years. Before he died, he made an authorized advertisement. In the ad, he appealed to people who had been smoking for many years. He said when you are smoking, you have to stop smoking. If you don't stop, that destroys your family and your life. For example, a man is smoking at the restaurant; we think that he is polite. When he is smoking, he doesn't mind everybody in the restaurant. If he has a thought that he�@should take care of his family or friends, he can't smoke there. Now, people don't allow smoke in the building so we can see people who find the smoking area which is outside of building. Also, if someone smokes at a restaurant, cigarette smoke makes the people annoyed. We want to have the food in fresh air and we don't want to die early because of cigarette smoke. So, if you smoke for years, you have to stop smoking for your future, your family, and your friends.﻿Smoking has always been an issue in our society - inflation of cigarettes, smoking areas, secondhand smoke, etc. All over the world people seem to be quitting smoking. One of the ways this has happened is increasing the cost of cigarettes. In South Korea this issue has been talked about a lot, but does not seem to be working. Recently the cost of Dunhill brand cigarettes has been raised to reduce the rate of smoking, but people who smoked Dunhills changed their brand to a cheaper brand. Secondly, smoking areas are not appointed well, which causes people to smoke in bus stops, inside buildings, and in public areas. In Canada, it is illegal to smoke inside buildings and in public areas. This should be put into action in Korea. And the last issue is secondhand smoking. This issue is related to the smoking area issue. I guess most people know that secondhand smoking is worse than smoking, and secondhand smoking can cause cancer and skin disease. A person I knew from my youth was healthy but she died from lung cancer from secondhand smoking; her husband was a chain smoker. I do not smoke in public areas because I know secondhand smoke is bad and I do not like the way the people see me. Smoking has always been an issue in our society.

﻿"No smoking". This is a sign that we can see everywhere. Ironically, we can also see many people smoking freely. Definitely, smoking is the issue in our country and the world. These days many countries ban smoking in official places and in other places. In Korea, we also ban smoking in many places, but I think smokers don't care about this rule. I really don't like the smell of smoking, so if someone smokes in the street my face is going to be frowning. I insist that we should make some rules like smokers have to smoke in restricted areas. It is a very great idea, I think. Many non-smokers are bothered because of smoking. It is very harmful to people's health and to our habitat. Cigarettes contain very toxic material, so people can't quit easily. I think that cigarette companies should increase cigarette prices, and then many people can quit their smoking habit more easily. It is a good idea that advertisers make many ads about not smoking. I hope many smokers can quit their smoking habit so other people can be safe everywhere and all the time. I don't know well how hard it is for smokers to quit smoking because I'm not a smoker. Although it is very hard to quit smoking, you should quit as soon as possible for your health. Maybe you can ask a doctor how to quit your smoking habit if you really want to quit your smoking habit.﻿I agree with the statement. According to the news on the Korean TV, smokers cannot smoke in public areas from 2013. I have four reasons for supporting the statement. First of all, if smokers smoke in restaurants, they influence other customers. Suppose other customers in the restaurant eating some food and smokers are smoking next to their table. The customers really do not like smell and it is disgusting. I think it is not good smoking in public areas. Second, smoking is not good for our health. According to a newspaper I saw, smoking damages smokers' lungs and they cannot live as long as non-smokers. Smoking take a toll on the lungs and prompts cancer of the lungs and lots of other disease. Third, if smokers are smoking in restaurants, other non-smokers are damaged from smokers. I am referring to second-hand smoking. I read some result of the second-hand smoking. It said that non-smokers are damaged if they smell tobacco. I was surprised about that result. The last reason not to allow smoking in restaurants is I think the most important thing in a restaurant is cleanliness. If smokers are smoking in the restaurant, lots of places in the store are dirtier than in a non-smoking restaurant because smoking makes the place dirty. Finally, I think smoking must be banned in restaurants.﻿Smoking is causing a lot of problems presently for students and adults. I bet our country is one of the places where people smoke the most. Honestly, I don't care whether they smoke or not. But students smoking? That's totally wrong. They're destroying their bodies completely before they even fully become an adult. They probably smoke because they think it makes them look cool. Yes, that is true, it does make someone who's smoking look cool. But is looking cool to other people worth more than their own health? Lots of people regret smoking when they get cancer or they make a hole through their neck. Before then, they can never realize how serious this is. Since smoking started to look cool, it's giving a really bad influence to little kids. For example, I saw kindergarten children smoking, not outside, but on the internet. They were spitting saliva out of their mouths. That's not what kids should do. If the government wanted people to make them stop smoking, why didn't they raise the price of the cigarette up to a hundred dollars? Who would dare to buy that? That would really help stop smoking. But then again, cigarettes bring a lot of profit to our land. It cigarettes become illegal to sell, our country will suffer damage in the financial losses. I guess we can't make those people who smoke stop smoking. I just hope it doesn't get worse than this.﻿I think smoking should be banned in public places like restaurants, because it causes more than 1000 deaths from lung cancer. Second hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also setting bad examples for teens and young adults. Also, scientists agree that smoking is dangerous. Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, strokes and heart disease. Smoking does not just harm the smoker; it also harms people nearby who breathe in the smoke. This is called passive smoking. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. People should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. Passive smokers do not choose to breathe in other people's smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public.﻿You are right. I agree with the topic. Smoking is terrible, awful and very bad. Smoking must be banned, not only in restaurants but also in any public places! But I think smoking has been banned at a restaurant already. Hasn't it? Imagine you eat at a restaurant and someone smokes next to you. I wouldn't eat anything if I were you. You lose both money and health if you smoke. Eventually, you pay for disease. What a silly idea! I work out, so I've never smoked and I don't even drink. But my father has smoked for over 20 years. I worry about his health. Smoking can also ruin families. Parents need to stop smoking for their children. Last week I saw something about smoking in a newspaper. The government said that now it's illegal to smoke on a road or a square. I love that. I am done talking about smoking. What else I can say is smoking is worse for other people than it is for the smoker! In addition, smoking makes people stink. Who would want to hang out with a smelly person? Right? Ok I need thirty more words. I hate to tell someone to stop smoking. So smokers need to stop smoking. Let's quit smoking!﻿In my childhood, my father always smoked near me. I thought that smoking was not a bad thing, but in middle school I saw a video that showed that smoking is so bad for people's bodies. I realized that smoking is a very bad thing. I do not smoke, but I am sure that my body is so bad. Because of my father, I experienced secondhand smoking. I don't care about people smoking, but smokers must not smoke near non-smokers. When I wait for a bus at the bus stop, I smell smokers' smoke. It is so bad, smoking near non-smokers. Sometimes, I went to restaurants, cafes and campus. I think that smoking is an unpleasant thing. The government must make non-smoking areas and introduce a smoking penalty system. When I am an adult, I will ban smoking for my children, because it is so bad for a mom with a baby. Smoking is also banned in playgrounds and kindergarten. This gives health benefits. I saw on television that a famous comedian died because of smoking. I was so scared when I saw his death. When I go to a computer fee room, I always feel smoking smell. Smoking should be removed forever.﻿Nobody thinks that smoking is healthy, but there are some people who don't want to quit smoking. They usually smoke everywhere; they even smoke in public places. I think they are addicted. If it makes people feel uncomfortable, smokers should be banned from smoking in public places. As you know, smoking causes so many disease, like lung cancer, tuberculosis, other cancers, etc. Its effects are not limited to smokers, but non-smokers are exposed to second hand smoke, too. Here is reason that why smoking should be banned in public places. First, it causes much disease. If it is banned to smoke in public place, it could reduce the smoking rate. As a result, many people could be healthier. It is very easy for second hand smoke to get a disease from second hand smoking. So I think it should be banned to smoke in public places. Second, if it is banned, it could make for cleaner streets. Usually people who smoke throw away butts on the street. Even though there are so many smoking stands, they don't use them, as if it is very natural act. But I think if it were banned, they couldn't throw away a cigarette. So it would make street clean. Third, if it is banned, it could prevent a big fire. Sometimes the cigarette you threw away could make a big fire. Of course, there are fires of other origins, but I think if you don't smoke in public places it also could reduce the fire rate. Thus I think smoking in public place should be banned by government. If this does not happen, it could make people get diseases, it could make streets unclean and uncomfortable, and it could also make a big fire. So I believe that it should be banned to smoke in public places.
