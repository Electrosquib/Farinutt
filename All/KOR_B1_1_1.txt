These days, the interior of all buildings is marked "non-smoking". Also, the toilet is non-smoking; you must smoke in the smoking room. Everyone knows that cigarettes have bad effects on the body, and I hate cigarette smoke. Thus, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, cigarettes contain bad things such as naphthalene and many other chemicals. Thus, I am sure that they are harmful things for both smokers and non-smokers. But, cigarette has the worst effect on non-smokers. You should not do damage to other people. Therefore, you should act responsibly. Second, isolate smoking rooms are available in all buildings. Smoking rooms only allow smoking within the room. For example, all coffee shops, restaurants or PC rooms have smoking rooms attached. So, it is right that you should smoke in the smoking room. Finally, cigarettes contain burning material. Lit cigarettes can burn down buildings. Actually, sometimes I have seen news content in which cigarette butts caused forest fires. I think that smoking deserves to be banned at all restaurants and bus stations. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned at buildings or restaurants.﻿I do not agree about smoking on campus. There are more non-smokers than smokers on campus. Because smokers cause damage to nonsmokers' health, and because smoking is bad for smokers' health, they must quit smoking. For Mandy Soled, college and nicotine go hand in hand. A 20-year-old student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Soled never smoked in high school. She doesn't smoke much over the summer, but as soon as a new semester starts, she is back to four or five cigarettes a day. What is it about college life that lures her to smoke? Stress? Peer pressure? Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. Once you start smoking, it is very hard, but not impossible, to quit. Until recently, I think smoking on college campuses was largely ignored. Alcohol is such a major issue in college that smoking takes a back seat. In the last few years, however, smoking has become a hot topic. One of the reasons for this increased importance is the recognition that the college years are crucial in making or breaking an addiction. As a college student, I have seen firsthand the prevalence of smoking. All across our campus, college students are lighting up at an alarming rate. In a campus survey I conducted of 15 college students in February 2002, eight students said they were current smokers. I surveyed eight males and seven females. My survey included 18 questions revealing gender, age, class, familial history of smoking, frequency of smoking, desire to quit, methods used to quit, awareness of hazards, etc. I surveyed several of my classmates in class, a few sorority sisters in our suite, and random students at the HUB.﻿Many people smoke at restaurants today. It is very unpleasant and I hate it. If I see people who are smoking when I am having a meal, I will be very angry. I also agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are two reasons why I hate people who smoke at the restaurant. First, smoking is not good for our health. As you know, many people know this truth and smoking affects other people as well as the smoker. Many non-smokers are suffering from secondhand smoke. Therefore, banning smoking from all restaurants is the only way we can prevent the dangerous effects associated with smoking. Second, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meals at restaurants because of smokers. When I was having my meal at a restaurant, I couldn't eat anymore because of cigarette smoke in the air, so I stopped eating. As always, many non-smokers are suffering because of smokers. In conclusion, smoking is not good for human health, as you know, and we should protect non-smokers by banning smoking from restaurants. It is a very important thing and smokers should also not bother non-smokers. So, smoking must be completely forbidden at all restaurants in the whole country.﻿In front of each building, so many people smoke cigarettes. Some people say that when they smoke cigarettes they feel free and can rest easily between work times. However, I think it's not a suitable way to behave. No matter how they feel, it's a really harmful way to act for everybody, including non-smokers. So, I want to insist that we should prohibit smoking cigarettes for several reasons. First, if someone smoke cigarettes next to others, the bystanders couldn't avoid the potential dangers. We always advise smokers that their children and family could face a potentially harmful situation; their family could have lung cancer, and could get some respiratory disease. For their own family, smokers always think of smoking cigarettes. Second, when someone smokes cigarettes, they can't easily stop smoking because of their addiction. According to several pieces of research, when smokers stop smoking, their hands may shake or they may gain weight suddenly. If they continue to smoke cigarettes, they would be more likely to get mental and physical disease compared to non-smokers. I totally agree that the government should make cigarette prices higher. If it spontaneously makes smokers decrease their intake, the cigarette market will have to get more tax and fix product prices higher.﻿Some people think that ban on smoking at all restaurants is bad. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons why I think so: other people's health, bad smell and clear environment of restaurants. First of all, other people's health is very important. If people smoke at restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the elderly and babies present, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarettes smell very bad and it can make people feel unpleasant. The people have a right to enjoy good smells at a restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at restaurants, the restaurants' environment can become dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarettes can go into the food. Also, the restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarettes. So, because of these three reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Cigarette is made of hazardous materials to be used by people. The composition of a cigarette includes a filter and manufactured tobacco. When they are smoked, many hazardous materials appear in the smoke, but the Filter gets rid of toxic material and it gives smokers  less toxic smoke. The toxic materials in cigarette smoke have lots of kinds, e.g., nicotine, tar, CO, etc. They cause critical damage to the human body. The lungs, in particular, are damaged by smoke. If humans smoke cigarettes, the smoke get into the lungs and causes cancer. But this danger is greater for non-smokers than for smokers, because non-smokers inhale the toxic materials without a filter. For this reason, smoking has a bad effect for non-smokers. Many people who divide into non-smokers or smokers are gathered in restaurants and public places in the country. At the restricted place, non-smokers will inhale toxic material against their wishes. So, the action of smoking in restaurants or public places has bad effects for non-smokers. They are exposed to a greater death rate than smokers for passive smoking. In conclusion, because of this dangerous effect, smoking - which damages our health - should be restricted for the health of non-smokers at restaurants and in public places.﻿I think we should ban smoking in public places completely because cigarettes are harmful to the body. The reason is that the diseases related to the smoking can be prevented and fire hazards can be reduced. Above all, making a rule that restricts smoking in public areas plays an important role in preventing smoking-related diseases. This is because there are all kinds of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The smoke is full of harmful components that can cause cancer, asthma, or other fatal diseases that can affect not only the smokers themselves but also non-smokers around them. Thus, by banning smoking in public places, we can reduce the risk of getting smoke-related diseases. Moreover, preventing smoking in public areas can contribute to decreasing fire danger. Cigarette butts that are thrown away without being fully extinguished can cause irreversible disasters like mountain fires. I have to consider everyone in the world for their families and their health. Also, a strong anti-smoking law should be introduced.﻿I don't support smoking in restaurants. The biggest reason is that it is harmful for our health. It causes a lot of diseases such as lung, throat, and mouth cancers, premature births, sterility and early menopause, and it makes one look older. Scientific studies show that addicted smokers' skin will be grey in color, thick, and wrinkled. In addition, the smokers can also harm the health of the other non-smokers with their cigarette smoke. Although a person likes smoking, other people do not want to breathe their smoke and get second-hand smoke diseases. In restaurants, people are eating something. During a meal, it is easy to breathe in second-hand smoke. In this case, second-hand smoke will be more than normal situation. Therefore, nowadays many countries have tried to make a law that smoking in restaurants is illegal. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we may be saving the lives of hundreds of people, including your own as well as your family's. If a survey was taken asking people how often they deliberately put the lives of their friends and family at risk, it's a pretty safe bet that most people would say never. However, they may be forced to reconsider their answer with regard to smoking.﻿Smoking is very harmful to human beings, but there are thousands of people smoking around the world, even though they know smoking is harmful. The most serious problem is that non-smokers are damaged by the second-hand smoke of smokers. Media has emphasized the danger of second-hand smoking. Lately, the notion of third-hand smoke has appeared. I have seen TV programs about third-hand smoke. A father usually smokes outside and washes his hands with soap. He hugs his baby and plays with him or her after smoking and washing his hands. Even though the baby doesn't smell the smoke, dangerous things are found on the skin of the baby. The research shows that the baby has the same amount of dangerous remnants as adult smokers. I was shocked by the results of this research. After I saw this program, I realized that we can't escape from the danger of smoking anywhere. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public areas where any person can drop by and eat there. In these areas, non-smokers are easily affected by smokers. Smokers have to know the effect of their smoking on others. The government should take action for the health of all citizens.﻿Some people who smoke are very rude. They smoke not only on the street, also in restaurants. When they smoke in restaurants, other people who don't smoke feel upset. Smoking creates fumes and dirty dust. People who smoke smell of cigarettes. That creates discomfort. I think people who smoke in restaurants are selfish. They enjoy smoking and do not care about other people who don't smoke. What I am talking about is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some restaurants have smoking seats, but there are non-smoking seats nearby. Fumes and dust move to every table in the restaurant. Guests in the restaurant might be angry if someone sitting at the next table is smoking. Then, there would be gossip about the restaurant's cleanliness and etiquette. It is a good choice for owners to forbid smoking in their restaurants. Restaurants are where people eat dinner. Maybe it is special dinner for someone. Smoking can break into that special mood. Apparently, smoking in restaurants is a very serious problem. I wish that smoking were banned in restaurants as soon as possible. I want to eat dinner in a restaurant where no one is smoking.
