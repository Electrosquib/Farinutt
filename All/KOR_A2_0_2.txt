Nowadays many students have part-time jobs to pay for their college tuition. It's going to be a problem because we have to do it, especially at private schools. I think it is important for us, however there are many disadvantages. First, we are students. The most important thing to us is studying. The chance to have a part-time job is always around you however the chance to study is not always around you. For instance, consider someone who has started studying late. They thought that their part-time job is more important than studying, but they realized that they must study at the appropriate time. Therefore, a part-time job is not more important than studying. Second, we cannot concentrate on class. Generally, we do part-time jobs from the evening to late at night. Therefore, we cannot concentrate in our classes because of sleepiness. For example, I worked for a night delivery service from 10:00pm to 6:00am. It was so hard on the first day, but I adapted to the environmental change so I slept during classes. Therefore, part-time jobs disturb students' concentration in class. Consequently, part-time work has become a social problem. Many news outlets report it as a social problem, so the Government has adopted a wise policy to encourage students to concentrate on their studies. The problem can only be resolved by the Government because it's a hot potato for college students. We have to study for our future and part-time jobs are not our first priority.﻿I agree that college students should have a part-time job. Because if college students have part-time job, they improve socially. College students experience social life early. They improve socially more effectively than students who don't have a part-time job. As a result, these students will get a job and they can adapt more easily. Also, college students earn money themselves without their parents' help. Therefore, they will know that earning money is very hard and they will think that money is precious. They won't easily spend money and their parents' money worries will be reduced. Finally, the reason I agree that college students should have a part-time job is making friends. While they work part-time jobs, they meet many people. They can make many friends and they meet many diverse people, and they will improve their speaking skills. Because speaking skills are very important to their life, improving speaking skills is helpful. For college students, having a part-time job has many benefits. Therefore, college students should experience part-time work. A part-time job related to their major is more effective than an unrelated job. If college students don't disturb their study, their having a part-time job is very good.﻿I think part-time jobs are very good for students. I will write about why. First, we can earn our own money. We can use that for eating, shopping or recreation. I can also help my mother with my university registration fees. Second, it can help us to experience our society. It will help you learn how to conduct yourself at your company and how to face your boss. Also, you can make friends at work. I can save my money for the future and to buy my parents birthday gifts if I save monthly, and not depend on my parents to be grown up. Nowadays university fees are very expensive, too, so that is why students look for part-time jobs. Another reason is society experience. Many people graduate with no social experience, and that can be problem when adjusting to working in a company. To face one's boss, it takes a lot of courage because the boss can fire you at any time. At school we have friends and at work we can make friends too. Making friends at work can help me adapt to work and teach me how to work well. These reasons are why I agree with students' doing part-time jobs.﻿I think having a part-time job is very important, because we are going to gain experience in our part-time job and we will earn much money. But many students think that part-time jobs are more important than studying. Nevertheless, I think that many people are going to have a part-time job. Part-time job experience is to be commended, because a part-time worker meets many people and gains experience. Here are some reasons why students should have a part-time job. First, the part-time job experience is going to teach sociability and allow them to meet many people. Because many part-time jobs are customer-facing these days, sociability is very important. Many customers like to have highly socially-skilled workers. Therefore, many employers choose to have employees with developed social skills. Second, the part-time job is going to earn much money. Many students receive pocket money from their parents, so they haven't any part-time job experience or experience earning money. When they receive earned money, they are going to be pleased. Finally, they get experience of many part-time jobs. These days Korea has many kinds of job, so students are going to get experience. When finding a full-time job, part-time job experience is very important. In conclusion, many students will have part-time jobs. And students study more, so they will survive in a competitive society.﻿I think that college students'part-time jobs are important because of the tuition fees getting higher. Students' parents get in trouble paying all their childrenfs tuition. They find it difficult to afford all the tuition for four years, so most students have the responsibility to help their parents. But if someone who is not rich is thinking "I don't need to have a part-time job", then that person doesn't need to have a part-time job because doing a part-time job is optional, not compulsory. But I think that a person going to college should have part-time job for two reasons. First, they can help their parents who find it difficult to pay for their son's or daughter's tuition for four years. Of course, the money they earn can't cover all the tuition, but the money is not only tangible money. It shows care for their parents. And they can use the money they earned their allowance. We can see this as a small thing, but it is a big thing and a source of pride for them. Second, they can go through out of the college. That is important. It is easy to people who go to college thinking "I'm a just a student". But college students are not just students. College is one type of small society, so college students are members of society. So I think college students'part-time jobs are important.﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, students can gain social experience with a part-time job. After graduating from school, students will start their social lives. However, if students start social lives without social experience, they will have difficulty. Therefore, having a social life in advance is a good thing. Also, nowadays, when companies hire people, they prefer experienced people. In order to get a job, students need more social experience. Next, the second reason is that they can live without the help of their parents. They can earn money and appreciate their parents. Today, a lot of students need the help of their parents, so a lot of parents help their child. However, when students have a part-time job, they don't need the help of their parents. Finally, they can build friendships. They have to meet a lot of people and talk to them because dealing with people is difficult in social life. People dislike unkind, unfriendly, and rude people, so, they can learn how to act kind and friendly. Although there are a lot of reasons, I think this is the most important reason. For these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿Recently, the biggest issue for college students is tuition. Specifically, it is like a “tuition bomb.” We pay large amounts of money for tuition. Look around; there are many people who get loans. In my opinion, college students having a part-time job is not important. It is dependent on condition. If you are rich enough, you don't have to worry about paying for tuition. If you are not, you must be a part-time worker. You can't afford to pay for tuition, which means you are not rich, so you have to get a loan to attend college. Then you have a debt, and repay it yourself, because you are not child anymore and can't bother your parents to pay tuition. However, there is an exception, which is a scholarship. Theoretically, receiving a scholarship is easy. You can just study hard and participate in a party or festival that you belong to, but my experience, receiving a scholarship for four years is very difficult . So, I have had a part-time job since I was 20. Therefore, if you cannot study hard, and are not rich, you have no choice. You must find a part-time job. So, a part-time job is not important for everyone. It is only important to some.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, college students will look for a nice job after graduation, and they know that when owners need to pick new staff, they usually want people who have experience in another office. Students can gain experience by visiting other countries, working somewhere, and doing an internship. My friend worked for a long time at one company when she was a college student, and then she could get a job there. Second, students always feel that college fees are very expensive. So, they need a lot of money for college life, but they cannot work for a long time or every day because they are students and students have to study. Finally, they can learn the value of money. Today, we live with a richness of everything. If we want something or want to change our telephone or watch, we can get it from parents or somebody else. So, we don't know the value of money. I think that if college students have a part-time job, they will grow into great people and will change their lives, so a part-time job for college students is very important.﻿Is it important for college students to have a part-time job in our country? I agree that it is. Many college students need money for their school life. They want to do a lot, buy a lot of things, and eat a lot of food. However, they do not have enough money to do everything. So, they should earn money. However, they cannot have a full-time job because they are students and the most important thing is to study. So, if they want to work, they should get a part-time job. Of course, parents give money to their child, but it is not enough to keep up with their life. Sometimes, when students work, the business owner does not give them money on the day it's due. So many students cannot get money even though they work hard for it. So, the country should make a law concerning this problem, and the owner should follow this rule when they hire students part-time. In conclusion, a law should be made and the students should work hard to earn money for their life.﻿I think that having a part-time job is important for college students because if we have a part-time job, we can increase our responsibility. Many adults say that students should study hard rather than spending time on part-time jobs. However, I think part-time jobs for college students are good because they can learn the importance of money and responsibility. The first reason is students can gain experience. Working experience is really important for getting a job. Also, students can learn to respect other people. The second reason is students can gain valuable insight about a career. Before I go into my real field of work, I need to learn skills and knowledge of the work place, and I want to see which job really fits me. The last reason is to earn money. Many people who are University students want to get their own money so they can buy pretty clothes and eat good food. However, we shouldn't only concentrate on getting money because we are still students. We have to focus on studying our subjects. Working for money might hinder our focus on studies because it takes a lot of valuable time. I think the best solution is to get money on vacation and study during the semester. I believe having a part-time job is very beneficial for college students.
