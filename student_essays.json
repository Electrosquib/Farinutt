    "﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, a large number of college students have a part-time job. Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine, for example: when Lily was a college student, she worked in the supermarket as a promoter or worked as a private tutor every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly acquired a good job after graduating from university. In terms of other students' opinions, they think that they can buy the desired goods that their parents cannot afford. I know a student who works part-time in a restaurant as a waiter so that he can earn enough money to buy a computer. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents don’t always agree with us about getting part-time jobs. They are afraid for our studies and our safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is beneficial for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to gain knowledge from our part-time jobs and use them as helpful tools for our development.﻿In recent years, college students taking a part-time job have become very popular in the big city. Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, I disagree with this. I have some reasons to support my idea. Firstly, I think that everyone has tasks of varying levels of importance in different periods. For a student, studying is the key priority. If you cannot study well, you will be wasting your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden by taking a part-time job. However, this might have a bad effect on their studies. They do not know that the most important thing that their parents want is for them to learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention to your studies now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, but learning professional skills and applying your knowledge into practice yourself are the most serious tasks during university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. Thus, don't be influenced by others and try to keep gaining knowledge; you will succeed in the future as a result.﻿Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions in answer to this question. Some people think that it is good to have a part-time job, while others don't think that it is good to have one. I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for several reasons. Some people might agree with this assertion. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' financial burden. Besides, it can also increase their chances to practice their knowledge in society. However, some people object to this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste the students' time and affect their studying. Therefore, students should just focus on studying hard. As far as I am concerned, students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well-informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, by being selective, they can avoid working at jobs that everyone can do, and thus avoid wasting their time and learning less. Not being selective will make working ineffective because they won't be doing the job that they should be doing. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and be selective about the kind of job that we take.﻿I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The following reasons explain my idea. College students need to not only gain knowledge of books, but also practice their knowledge in universities. College students have a part-time job, which fulfills their interests. College students can acquire knowledge from books and practice through home teaching, and they can get life experience through a part-time job. They can discover their shortcomings and advantages. A part-time job is good for college students' growth. For example, the achievements of people who have also experienced university life prove that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. During college, students go through the experience of a part-time job, and all levels of their abilities are raised. They become more confident about themselves and they have great motivation to work. The reasons above explain why I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is good for the development of college students. Thus, if you have a chance to have a part-time job, try to get one and work hard at it. You will receive advantages.﻿Today, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. Different people hold different viewpoints. Some people agree with the idea that a part-time job is very good for college students. In my opinion, it is not so important for college students to have part-time jobs. I have some reasons to prove my point. Some people think that there are some advantages if students take part-time jobs because they can gain experience and build up their good character. Further, students can earn money from doing part-time jobs, so if they are from a very poor family, they can reduce their family’s financial burden. However, after-school work also brings a lot of problems. For example, some students think about their part-time jobs all the time and cannot decide that study is more important right now. As such, some students now have some problems with studying and some don't even go to class on time. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and gain important knowledge. They can earn money later. Thus, college students need to know that studying is more important than working right now.﻿I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. While we are growing up, we can look after ourselves. It was our mothers who took us into this beautiful world. They taught us how to walk, to speak and so on. Now, it is our turn to care for our parents. Thus, earning enough money by working for our boss at a part-time job may be a good choice. In addition, we enrich our experience, which can only be acquired from a real work environment. On the other hand, we shouldn't focus too much of our attention on it because we are just students right now, not workers. If we don’t have enough fundamental knowledge, then we can't do well in our part-time jobs. Do not forget that our studies can help our work while our work can help our studies. To obtain much knowledge is the main mission of college students. How to balance studying and working is the main challenge for freshmen. Thus, planning is most important. Having a part-time job during summer or winter vacation is a great idea. We are also adults, so we can make our own schedules. A part-time job is an important part of our college student life!﻿As more and more college students have a part-time job, most people start to pose this question: is it important for college students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, it is not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. I can list some reasons to explain my opinion. First, although studying in college is relaxing, it also requires hard work. For students, every second is important. If we have time to do a part-time job, why not spend the time on gaining knowledge? Second, as most college students don't have much social experience, they can be cheated very easily by others. They don't have the ability to keep themselves out of danger. I think the school environment is very safe. If students go out to work, I can't imagine what danger they will encounter. Last but not least, nobody can guarantee that the part-time job will give students a lot of valuable experience. On the other hand, it's very beneficial for students to join a school club or do extracurricular activities. They can chat with other students; they can share happiness with each other, which is a very good thing. All in all, having a part-time job is dangerous and unnecessary for college students. Maybe students are curious about the part-time job or they want to try it. However, I think the knowledge of books is also interesting.﻿As we can see, having a part-time job has become more and more popular among college students. From my perspective, this phenomenon is good. It is really important for college students to have a part-time job, as a part-time job may let students gain more experience, help them apply their knowledge, and allow them to know how hard it is to earn money. Firstly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they may gain plenty of advantages while working. They may learn how a job functions, how to work with their colleagues and boss, and how to be confident. For example, I worked for a TV program as a translator for a month, and I acquired the benefits mentioned above. Thus, a part-time job is really important for a college student. Secondly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because they can practice what they have learnt in college. Practice is the only way to verify knowledge, and further practice can also help our studies. When I was working for the TV program, I really learnt a lot. I have to say that all of the things that I learnt there were really useful. Therefore, if a college student wants to gain more, he or she should go and find a part-time job. Lastly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because a part-time job can help them establish the conception of money. They will soon learn how difficult it is to earn even $100, they will understand the value of money, and furthermore, they will understand their parents. In other words, college students can grow through a part-time job, they can practice their knowledge more, and most importantly, they can establish the right conception of money.﻿I do not agree with the point that having a part-time job is important for college students. Maybe some people think that taking a part-time job can help them in many respects—help them explore the knowledge outside of books and even gain financial independence. There are others who think that part—time jobs will have a strong negative influence on studying, as working often gives students strong pressure and becomes a burden. This might make students join fewer college activities. In my opinion, I think students should pay more attention to studying than to part—time jobs. A part—time job is a small priority for students. For college students, time is very limited and valued. If students spend their limited time on working at part—time jobs, there is no doubt that they will have less time for studying. They will also have little time for college activities. If someone thinks a part—time job will give them extra earnings, I am certainly against it. College is not the proper period for students to earn money. It is the best time for learning varied knowledge. If they gain some money now, they will lose a lot more in the future. To sum up, college students should not take part—time jobs when they are studying in college. Part—time jobs just make students lose their way or lose heart. For students, school work is more important than having a part—time job. Knowledge is power.﻿Nowadays, college students want to have a part-time job during their study periods. In my opinion, I think everything has two aspects much like how one coin has two sides. On the one hand, if you want to gain more experiences in society, to have a part-time job is a good thing; on the other hand, if you pay more attention to your part-time job to the extent that you lack enough time for your study lessons, then having a part-time job is not a good thing. For a college student, studying is most important. Most college students believe that a part-time job can offer them more job opportunities in the future, and that it can also improve their confidence and sense of responsibility. In this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. However, there are other college students who believe that college is a place of study. They consider that if we spend too much time on working at a part-time job, we may delay our school work. In this respect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. Recently, college has become more and more market-focused, and a college student must be provided with a variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities.",
    "﻿Some people hold that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, I don't agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to support and explain my opinion. For one thing, everyone has his or her own hobby. No one likes others to change his or her hobby. If somebody likes to smoke, we have no right to prevent them from having dinners at restaurants for this reason. For another thing, restaurants are public places, and while smoking at public places is not good, we can do nothing but advise smokers. However, the restaurants' owners can set up a room for smokers. When they want to smoke, they should go to that room to smoke. This can separate smokers from most customers, and I believe more and more customers will be interested in the restaurants that reserve a room for smokers. With this method in restaurants, both smokers and other customers will be happy. Thus, it is difficult to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country because we can do other things to solve this problem. However, as we all know, smoking is an immediate threat to health; it can cause serious cancer. As such, we all had better smoke less.﻿For many years, smoking has been a hot topic for people all over the world. People always say that smoking is harmful to our health and that we should reduce the population of smokers. Nevertheless, should smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country? My answer to this question is yes. On the one hand, smoking does less good than harm to our health. As a restaurant is a place of eating and drinking, if one person in the restaurant starts smoking, it will pollute the whole air of the restaurant. Those people around the smokers will not have the good mood to have their meals any longer. Some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous in many cases. We know that people in restaurants all want to be healthy. On the other hand, smoking in the restaurant may cause the restaurant to catch on fire easily. It is dangerous for us to have a meal in a dangerous place. I read some articles in the newspapers that indicated that some restaurants caught on fire because smokers threw their cigarettes into some places in the restaurants after smoking. Thus, because of the reasons above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let us keep our eating environments healthy.﻿Nowadays, it is generally accepted that smoking is becoming more and more of a problem in our country. This phenomenon brings great damage, especially when it relates to smoking in restaurants. Some think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants; others don’t think so. I prefer the former one because I have some reasons below. There are many reasons accounting for my opinion. On the one hand, smoking in restaurants will damage smokers’ health and also other people's health. Most people know that smoking is harmful and can lead to many terrible diseases. It is not fair for non-smokers to get diseases because they sit together with smokers in restaurants. So we must insist on the ban. On the other hand, smoking will damage the environment. People want to eat in a clean restaurant. The unclean environment of the restaurant will make people unhappy and have a bad effect on them. People will not like the restaurants if there are many smokers inside. Clearly, if we are blind to this problem, it is very likely that restaurants will receive more and more complaints about smoking. We must pay attention to this problem.﻿I disagree with the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My reasons are below. Completely banning smoking at all the restaurants does not fit with the world of reality because a lot of men smoke now. As such, it would be impossible to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men may be against this ban. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. Further, those smokers will not go to the restaurants with the ban, which will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problems. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harmful for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for the health of the people, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking helps them in many ways. Some say that they feel happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoke, for all the restaurants want to get more financial gain. I think maybe we can do another thing to solve the smoking problem in restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now.﻿Generally speaking, I don't agree with the idea of topic B, which is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, I like to discuss the reasons for my opinion. To begin with, smoking in the restaurant is a right. Restaurants are public places for all customers, so no one is qualified to limit who can go to them. What's more, people should observe the law, and not just do anything that they want to do. In the next place, we can reserve a smoking room for those people who are already addicted to smoking. In this way, we protect the smokers' personal rights. Additionally, when smokers eat in the restaurants, they will not disturb the other customers. Then, the quantity of cigarettes sold will decrease, thereby affecting the economy of the society immediately. On the other hand, which is the last point, this ban will not only incite smokers' negative moods, but also lead to the development of a social trend. Some smokers think that smoking can help them solve difficult problems and relax their thought. In the end, to draw a conclusion from above, I strongly believe that smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can take some other ways to solve the problem of smoking in restaurants.﻿In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I have some reasons to support my idea. Smoking is an unhealthy habit because cigarettes contain burnt soil and something that can cause cancer. It also destroys people’s bodies. Smokers usually have some diseases. People having smoked for a long time are killing themselves day by day. What is more, it is obvious that the people who eat with them breathe in the same polluted air, which leads to people losing interest in what they are tasting. Further, the second-hand smoke is harmful to their health too. If the law of banning gets through, the atmosphere of restaurants will be more perfect, and the good smell of delicious food plus nothing else will fill the whole room. The more fresh air they breathe and the less smoke they inhale, the longer life they will have. The cleaning of public places should not only be applied to the restaurant. The dining room should be completely devoid of smoke too. If all the restaurants are clean, I believe more people will benefit from this. So all in all, the government should do something to ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country now.﻿In recent years, many people are talking about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned in all public places including restaurants, because it has a bad influence on the health of people. On the one hand, smoking causes diseases in many people. We know from books that smoking harms not only the people who smoke but also all the people who sit around them. In some magazines, some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous sometimes than first-hand smoke. Many people die because of second-hand smoke. In restaurants, the people who smoke are harming the people who are having meals in the same place at the same time. On the other hand, smoking makes the air in the restaurants terrible. In our country, many times I have had meals in restaurants where someone sitting close to me has been smoking. It has made me feel uncomfortable but I never know what to do. I am sure that smoking is harmful to everyone. There is no denying that if smoking is banned in all public places like restaurants, most of us will breathe in fresher and cleaner air and have a happier meal. We would not have to worry about smoke in restaurants any longer.﻿With social development, forbidding smoking takes a more and more important place in the development of civil society. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is bad for our health, smoking in restaurants causes bad effects on other people, and we need to build a more harmonious society. First, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is harmful to our bodies, especially while there is smoke in a restaurant. As we all know, cigarettes equal poison. However, we can't ban cigarettes due to the contribution to the economy given by cigarette companies. So what we can do is to stop smoking in restaurants to protect people from second-hand smoke. Second, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant may annoy other people. From my perspective, smoking in public is rude, for smoking is a kind of private behavior, and many people hate the smell of smoke. So smoking in a restaurant may make people feel unhappy. Last, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because we need a more harmonious society. According to what has been mentioned above, smoking makes other people feel uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is against what we are seeking—a harmonious society. In that case, to get a better image, to build a civil society, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, as smoking in restaurants is harmful to our bodies as well as our mental and social development.﻿I absolutely agree with the point that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. A restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smoking will destroy the warm atmosphere and also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that smoking depends on personal preferences, but it is a selfish behavior. It will make other people unhealthy. The important thing is that smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like the people who smoke in public places. As is known to all, smoking just increases the risk of cancer in people. Moreover, second-hand smokers are more influenced by the smoke than smokers are. Especially in public places, smoking is extremely harmful. The smoke from cigarettes is poisonous gas. If there is no one smoking in a restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokers give up smoking so it would also be beneficial for them. A professor called Peter in a Hong Kong university said, “One cigarette can kill at least 50 mice.” Smoking just makes people feel bored with no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this by themselves. We have an obligation to make sure that people have healthier lives.﻿There has recently been a heated discussion about banning smoking in restaurants. I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. I used to ask some people why they would want to smoke. They answered that there are many reasons for it. The first guy said that his work and family gave him much stress, and smoking seemed to be the only way for him to release the pressure. Moreover, smoking has been like his best friend, one to whom he could tell everything that he wanted to say. The second guy also had the same reasons as the first guy. In addition, he thought that if he could smoke a good cigarette, he would look like a rich man. So I thought smoking was a way to show one's riches. Through the analysis, I think smoking in all restaurants is nothing but harmful. There are three reasons to support my ideas. First, smoking is usually bad for our health, and if he or she is smoking in the restaurant, the smoke will spread out all over the restaurant, and other people will also be affected by the smoke. Second, as using a good cigarette to show off one's riches is not a good social trend, we should ban this bad social trend together and encourage people not to smoke in restaurants anymore. Third, a restaurant is a place where some people can eat food or chat with others. As such, if you are smoking in the restaurant, you may affect other people’s ability to eat food happily. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

    "﻿Society has more and more challenges for college students, so it is important for us to have much experience. In our country there are plenty of college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's quite common to see students busy after classes. But why is it important for us to have part-time jobs? First, I think part-time jobs are a good way to count our thumbs. College isn't as busy as high school. When we finish our studies, so much time is wasted on playing computer games or doing other boring things. If we have a part-time job, we will try our best to do it. After all, it's a way to show the abilities we have. Second, part-time jobs can help us know more people. Colleges just have students and teachers, but society has quite different people. They do all kinds of work, and experience interesting things of which you have never heard. Through your part-time job, you could develop good interpersonal relationships. After you graduate, you will go into society. When you need help, these people can give it to you. Finally, the most important benefit is that you can get the experience that books can't teach you. Practice is the way to show your knowledge. If you can only talk about how to do it, no one will believe that you can. You have to study what you should do, and part-time jobs would let you experience this. Thus, college students' having a part-time job is necessary and important.﻿Nowadays, college education has attracted the attention of society. What should the college education be? What ought college students to learn? The most common argument is whether college students should take a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job is vital for students. As we all know, students have a lot of free time to manage, so it would be very convenient for them to take a part-time job. In the future, students must step into society and face a variety of difficulties. Having a job can help them gain life experience; what's more, they can meet all walks of life and learn how to cope with complex relationships between them and colleagues. Further, students can make their own money and may realize that it is hard for parents to earn money. However, having a part-time job also has an unfavorable aspect. As the main task for students is to study, having a job may occupy most of their free time and may affect students' daily lives. Taking a part-time job is not a bad thing as long as we do not overwork but stick to reality and our personalities. I think if we can manage our time efficiently to take a job, we will be sure to get lots of benefits and more chances to be distinguished in the future.﻿As college students, we aren't very busy, so we can spend a lot of time doing the things we like. Some students do sports, such as playing football and running. Some students play computer games, such as dota and dnf. Some students read books, such as novels and poetry. What I think is the most important thing we should do in our free time is working in a part-time job. College is an important place connecting school and society. We not only learn knowledge here, but also learn experience which we can't learn from class. Thus, having a part-time job can solve this problem. In fact, a part-time job can make our college life substantial. From the part-time job, we can learn how to deal with work problems and how to work with others. We can also develop good habits. The most important lesson is that we can understand how hard making money is, so that we can make a good preparation for later life. College life is colorful, so we don't need to study as hard as we did in senior high school. We should learn to allocate our time and know what we really need. Having a part-time job is important to us; it's not only an opportunity, but also a challenge.﻿If you are resolved to have a part-time job, what are your purposes? Is it the money, or is it the experiences and the learning in the process of working that lure you to take a job? As we know, most of us have to step into society after graduation, and the society which will confront us is quite different from the campus life we are used to living in. So, if money is your solitary goal and you cannot be distracted by the expansion of your circle or the acquisition of communication skills, I suggest you'd better concentrate on your study and do not bother to think of a part time job for the simple reason that high marks can get you a better job. But if you want a part-time job for more than just money, you can gain the advantage of all that it has to offer. In the change from an excellent university student to a new employee, you may be subjected to scorn and criticism often, which will prompt you to reflect on yourself and define who you are. Taking a part-time job will give you a glimpse of the real world and make you well-prepared for the future. By observing society first-hand, you learn a lot outside the book. So, you can see my opinions quite clear now. Put away the money you can get and let yourself develop quickly in your part-time job experience!﻿Nowadays, quite a number of college students have part-time jobs. But is it necessary for them to do so? In my opinion, the answer can be various, depending on the students themselves. Undoubtedly, taking a part-time job is a special experience which provides youths with the chance to become familiar with society as well as to gain more practical skills. In the process, students learn how to communicate with different kinds of people and how to deal with challenging situations. Besides, the money they acquire from the job will certainly reduce their parents’ financial burdens more or less. However, it can't be ignored that some students fail to do more important things in order to take part-time jobs. They spend time that should be focused on learning to work, thus leading to a decline of grades. The fact is that the first priority for students is still studying. Additionally, some young people fail to spend their money reasonably. Instead, they fall into the habit of wasting money. Thus, it can be concluded that taking a part-time job is rewarding and eye-opening for those who have good self-regulation, but it may produce some negative side effects if the student lacks good planning skills. In common with many things, having a part-time job is a double-edged sword. If you want to have one, do be careful.﻿Nowadays many people hold a pessimistic attitude towards college students' behavior, specifically as it relates to having part-time jobs. For me, I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs for several reasons. First and foremost, it is a perfect opportunity for experience-lacking college students to practice their knowledge. Part-time jobs open a new door for inexperienced students to encounter and learn to adapt to the complex society, which can broaden their horizons and strengthen their abilities. Secondly, taking up part-time jobs is also an approach to relaxing. As we know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Getting along with various kinds of people and working in a group can bring a fresh feeling during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can also earn money via part-time jobs, which can help to support their lives and allow them to realize the hardship required to acquire every coin. As to those against part-time jobs, saying that they are a waste of time and have a bad impact on studying, I don't think they are right. As mentioned above, having part-time jobs is meaningful, as it not only strengthens students, but also makes them mature enough to set foot into society. As for studying, what is known to all is that appropriate practice contributes to studying by combining theory and practice. All in all, taking up part-time jobs should be encouraged among college students.﻿Nowadays, as most college students have no considerable social experience, what they have learned and what they are going to learn seem to become alienated from reality. Thus, the question of whether college students should have a part-time job has aroused wide attention. Indeed, we should attach more importance to part-time jobs. College students can benefit a lot from having a part-time job. To begin with, we can earn some money in order to lighten our parents' financial load. As we all know, college tuition is not a small sum of money. Some students pay a lot for it, only to gain little knowledge in their college lives. Beyond that, it is also a heavy burden, especially for a less well-off family. Besides, in the course of the job, we have to cope with a variety of people and communicate various words. Obviously, it is a great opportunity for us to gather experience and learn interpersonal skills. Further, what we learn from the part-time job can contribute to the future development of excellence. Last but not least, we can adjust ourselves to the society in advance. When we enter society, there are many objective factors that you can never change or foresee. That is to say, what we learn in college is theoretical and not enough for us to face all kinds of situations. It is because of the part-time job that we learn to combine theory with practice. From this, we can draw the conclusion that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.﻿There is currently a controversial debate on part-time jobs, concerning whether we should take a part-time job and how much time we should spend on a part-time job. It is natural that people from different backgrounds hold divergent attitudes towards the issue. People in favor of having a part-time job claim that it can release their financial burdens, especially as it is already common for young people to bear a loan from the bank to support their families or themselves. Further, a part-time job may even entertain the person as well as bring in money, if the job relates to his or her interest. In this way, people will make full use of their time and be energetic all the time. In contrast, people who hold the opposite opinion argue that a part-time job will occupy a big share of people’s attention and may lead them to poor health. They cannot focus their full attention on their main work, which is why part-time jobs are banned in lots of companies. For my part, I would side with the first point of view. Part-time jobs do fill our spare time when we have the passion to do something interesting and attractive. So seek a part-time job, and be rich both in wealth and spirit.﻿Part-time jobs are not unfamiliar to college students. Actually, many college students have part-time jobs or have previously worked at some part-time jobs. It is very important for college students to have part-time jobs for several reasons. As you know, most of our college students are already over eighteen years old, which is to say, we are adults. As such, we should try our best to be independent, and not just depend on our parents. The best way to be independent is to make money by ourselves. At the same time, the money we make can also be used to buy something that we want and to do something that we want to do, such as traveling, attending some clubs and so on. Besides, part-time jobs can develop our abilities and establish a good foundation for our future jobs. It is known to us all that experience is very important when applying for a job. Furthermore, a part-time job can help us find out more about the society and let us know what kinds of people society needs. Only in this way can we make good decisions and choices to shape our future. In a word, part-time jobs are so important for our college students that every one of us should try our best to take up some part-time jobs. It will contribute significantly to our present life and our future.﻿A part-time job is a job taken outside of classes in college. If we have a part-time job, we gain a lot of experience. We learn to arrange time. We learn to arrange money. Further, we learn to do the job in groups in the office we work in. Work is not easy. It's not simple like a class in university. You have to do the job according to the customer's tastes. For example, if you take a part-time job as a freelance photographer, you may have to prove to your customer through a portfolio that you are a real photographer and that you can complete the job in a good condition and take good pictures. If you have good management, you can save a lot of earnings from your part-time job. On the other hand, some parents do not want or disagree that college students should have a part-time job because they think that if the students have a job, they may become lazy to go to class in university. However, the condition applies again for the students: they must be able to arrange their time.",
    "﻿Smoking is one of the worst habits in the world, but there are still so many people smoking everywhere. So should smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country? The answer is positive. A cigarette includes a lot of harmful materials. As you know, it's pernicious for our health. Smoking negatively influences not only the person who smokes, but also the other person who smells the smoke. If plenty of people smoke in public places, human beings' health will be harmed, even if they haven't smoked ever. After all, it is unfair to let somebody smoke anywhere around them and destroy their bodies. Of course, restaurants are the places where we can enjoy our life. We should eat food with happy feelings. A cigarette can attract your attention, and then you will forget what you are enjoying. It's a bad habit that disrespects nature. We'd better be grateful for the entire world. Besides, smoking in restaurants easily causes fire accidents. People often forget to put out the cigarette, which causes the accidents. Out of the many things that the above has shown us, the most important thing is that a lot of people can die in fires. The sad experience warns us to be careful with smoking. In other words, smoking leads to too many unhappy things, and so it should be banned at all restaurants in the country.﻿Wherever you go, you may certainly find people smoking, especially at restaurants. Smoking has become a widespread phenomenon. Men, women and even children have the habit of smoking. We don't have the right to stop them from smoking, but the law can decide where they can smoke and where they can't. As such, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking can release one's stress indeed, but its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. It is harmful to our body, especially the lungs. The smoke that smokers release also does harm to nonsmokers. Restaurants are public places where people have meals, and so the environment must be clear. Smoking in the restaurants not only pollutes the environment but also pollutes the food. What's more, smoke can spread freely in the restaurant, which is to say, all the customers in the restaurant will suffer from the awful gas, and the quality of the environment cannot be assured, nor the meals enjoyed. Hence, banning smoking in restaurants is a wise act and we must conduct it as soon as possible not only to make the dining environment more comfortable but also to make us more harmonious and healthier. Only when we do that can we enjoy our meals in the restaurant with delight.﻿It is reported by the World Health Organization that there have been more than five million deaths caused by smoking. It is easy to see that smoking is very bad for our health. What's worse, second-hand smoking hurts our bodies without our knowledge. This problem is so serious that we have to do something to protect ourselves. The most effective and easiest suggestion is banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Most people in the world don't like to smoke and large numbers of them even hate it because of its uncomfortable gas. So banning smoking not only meets people's will, but also saves their lives. Tobacco is also very expensive, which means that smoking wastes a lot of money, and that quitting smoking can save money. The restaurant is the most important pubic place in our daily life, so banning smoking here can lead to the biggest and best effects. We do not want to be hurt when we have a good time, which would be very disappointing. Another reason is that a restaurant is a closed space with minimal airflow. People do not move often in restaurants, so bad gas can't be dispelled and can cause great harm. There is no benefit that we can take from smoking. Smoking greatly hurts smokers' and others' health. Thus, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I am 100 percent with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking in restaurants can not only give rise to unpleasantness, but also cause harm to other guests' health. As the air circulation is not good in a restaurant, the smell of smoke will probably affect other people. This little activity may completely ruin a dinner; how can you do that! On the other hand, there is no need for me to throw light on the harm of second-hand smoking because everybody knows it! Guests should not smoke in a restaurant, and neither should the cooks and the waiters, because the ash and smoke could directly get into the food and then get eaten by the customers. Meanwhile, smoking being banned does not mean that you could not smoke during a meal. If you cannot afford to live without a cigarette at the moment, it is OK for you to smoke outside. Maybe it is a little inconvenient, but for other people's sakes, do not complain! For the two reasons mentioned above, and the fact that you can still smoke outside the restaurant during a meal, put your hands up to show that you are with me! Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.﻿It is common sense that smoking does great harm to people's health. Thus, I am for the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, a small cigarette contains a great amount of harmful substances. Undoubtedly, the one smoking is constantly exposing his lungs to those substances, which, according to many researches, damage not only the lungs but also the heart and digestive system. Besides, second-hand smokers are victims as well. Although they are not addicted to smoking, they are affected unconsciously when staying in a room full of poisonous smoke. The restaurant is a place where people enjoy themselves by eating delicious food. As a result, a clean and comfortable environment should be provided instead of one that is full of cigarette smoke. At least, the health of children cannot be ignored. In other words, these are the very reasons why we should do something. In fact, some countries have banned smoking in public places years ago. Facing an increasing rate of diseases caused by smoking, we may as well try to take forceful measures, such as making laws, to reduce smoking in public places, and now, to stop smoking in all public places.﻿Recently, several bans forbidding smoking in all restaurants have been published, which has brought on heated discussions. As far as I'm concerned, to those bans I can't agree more. The reasons are just as follows: first and foremost, smoking is basically harmful to people's health, especially to the lungs, which can lead to fatal diseases, such as cancer. Secondly, as a restaurant is a public location, smoking there can not only hurt smokers themselves, but also do harm to those around them. What's worse, if there is a pregnant woman in the restaurant, the harm can be catastrophic. Thirdly, as there might be many non-smokers in the restaurant, perhaps even some smoking-sensitive people, smoking can lead to quarrelling, which will destroy the harmony and influence consumers' moods in the restaurant. Last but not least, even considering that several smokers are addicted to smoking, many other spaces outside of restaurants are still provided for them. All in all, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. In order to realize this aim, it is not enough that only the government implements some bans. Citizens, both smokers and non-smokers, ought to join in this campaign. Smokers can remind themselves that smoking is banned in the restaurant when they have the desire to take a cigarette out. Non-smokers can give advice to those who want to smoke during dinner to not smoke instead of just tolerating them or quarrelling with them directly. Only in these ways can smoking be completely banned in all restaurants in the country.﻿No one can deny the fact that smoking is harmful to our health, even the cigarette packaging says that. As lots of researches have shown time and again, quitting smoking contributes to the decrease of lung cancer incidence. Further, with every month that passes, there is more research showing the benefits of quitting, and the drawbacks of not quitting. Obviously, it is high time that we took some measures to solve this problem, and the smoking ban does help a lot. To start with, the smoking ban is the wave of the future. During recent years, people have paid more and more attention to their physical conditions. In some public spaces, like restaurants, people are forced to inhale second-hand smoke. Non-smokers long exposed to second-hand smoke suffer even more harm than smokers. Furthermore, for the smokers, if they know smoking is banned at the restaurant, they may smoke later. Since they can't see other people smoke, their desire for cigarettes may abate. Over a span of time, they may be less addicted to cigarettes. Lastly, the smoking ban also brings benefits to our society by contributing to the improvement of our social morality. Honestly, we still have a long way to go as regards the smoking ban, but we can reach the goal step by step. As far as we can see, banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is a good policy. Only in this way can we finally make the smoking ban come true!﻿Along with the rapid development of society, more and more problems are being brought to our attention, one of which is that our health is weaker than maybe 30 years ago, when our parents were teenagers. There are so many bad habits accounting for this issue. Smoking is one of these concerns, particularly smoking in public places. If people ask me whether we should ban smoking in public places, as far as I am concerned, I would agree that we should ban smoking in unsuitable situations, particularly in restaurants. Firstly, you are unconsciously harming the health of the people around you, no matter whether you are willing to or not. It is unfair for others to bear the bad effects of smoking. People come to have meals in restaurants; they don't come to get harmed by second-hand smoke. In the second place, it is considered impolite to smoke before many non-smokers. Gentlemen will never smoke before a lady and will speak ill of smoking. Last but not least, smoking is obviously breaking down your health, wherever you smoke, as cigarettes contain a variety of poisonous materials. Taking all of the above into account, we can easily draw the conclusion that banning smoking in public places is essential and that getting rid of smoking is also necessary. Thus, we should ban smoking completely in restaurants for both smokers’ and nonsmokers' health.﻿Smoking may be the most usual thing that can be seen in China. Both men and women smoke here and there. We all know that smoking is very harmful to our health, so banning smoking is very necessary, especially at all restaurants. Obviously, restaurants are the places where we take a meal. There are many different people together there. If there are too many people smoking at restaurants, it may lead to many serious problems. Firstly, it will make the restaurants chaotic. We all hope that we can have a meal in a good atmosphere. It is very hard for us to tolerate eating food in a bad environment where there is so much smoke. Secondly, smoking would produce much cigarette ash. It is very easy to make restaurants dirty with cigarette ash. We also can't have a meal in a dirty place. Thirdly and most importantly, smoking at restaurants is too harmful for our health. To start with, it is harmful to smokers. Smoking too much is very unhealthy for the lungs and the liver. Thus, forbidding smoking at restaurants is mainly good for smokers. Besides, it can be good for others at the restaurants. As we all know, smoking may cause more serious harm to people who don't smoke than to smokers themselves, especially when it comes to children. In any case, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. Everyone should applaud this wise idea, shouldn’t we?﻿Smoking is a habit that is very bad and destroys the smoker. It affects the health of the person smoking or in the atmosphere of smokers. It completely destroys the respiratory system, including the lungs and the respiratory tubes, and causes a very dangerous type of cancer. Smoking includes the use of the common cigarette to that of a developed form of cigarette that includes heroine. It involves every dangerous narcotic. Its ingredients that are very dangerous to the health are tobacco and nicotine. Nicotine is very dangerous to the memory of a person. Along with causing health problems, it is a habit that is very expensive. One has to spend a lot of money to keep up this habit. If one has no money, one does crimes to fulfill one’s need. Smoking completely destroys a person. The damages affect both physical and psychological health. A person with such a habit cannot do his work properly. He cannot give the proper time to his family. His health would be down day by day, as the average strength of a smoker is 70% of the strength of a non-smoker. This habit is very common in young boys. We should take steps against such a habit. Seminars should be arranged against smoking, as smoking is very dangerous to our health."

    "﻿Now many parents and teachers disagree that college students should have their own part-time jobs because they believe that students will spend their study time on working. But I do not think so. I think a part-time job is one of the most important things in college life. It will be the precious experience in your whole life for several reasons. Firstly, a part-time job is a good way to fill your spare time after class. Many students spend time on shopping, singing or playing computer games, which are pointless. Why not take a part-time job instead of participating in those entertainments? You can even earn some money from the job by yourselves at least. Secondly, a part-time job can add to your career experience, which is a very useful part in your future life after you graduate. You will learn much knowledge that cannot be found in school lessons. Social experience is the biggest advantage for graduated students when they interview for jobs. It's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Thirdly, as a matter of fact, a lot of college students are from poor families, so taking a part-time job for them is one of the ways to afford their college fees. Although the money may not be enough, that is all they have earned by themselves. From what I have said, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. Studying must also receive our attentions, so we should balance the part-time job with studying well. After all, the first job of students is studying.﻿In my opinion, I strongly agree with the idea that it is important for our college students to have a part-time job. Now we can see everywhere that students take part-time jobs like private teacher, seller and so on. Why do they do these jobs? What advantages benefit them? I think the main reason is money. With the improvement of our living standards, a lot of study materials are more expensive than before. Then the student has to take up some jobs to reduce considerable financial pressure. By doing so, we can also have the ability to travel or buy some items we like. We also hope that through this way, we can no longer be dependent on our parents. In addition, we can also accumulate some social experience. From kindergarten to high school, what we have learned is totally the knowledge from books. In this way, work experience offers a lot of benefits to our future jobs. In a word, there are many advantages for our college students to have some jobs: we not only make money, but also develop our independence. Thus, if you have a lot of free time after class, try to look for a part-time job and you will not regret it.﻿As we all know, some college students have part-time jobs to support their lives in college, and other students spend their parents' money to live their lives. Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in the common opinions of society, as well as in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs for several reasons. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' lives in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents no longer have to give money to us or can give less money to us. It can help with the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our abilities. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationships better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words, we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that we have earned by ourselves will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, and the house built by ourselves feels more comfortable. In the same way, spending the money earned by ourselves is more fulfilling. No matter where you come from—a poor family, a rich family, or a well-off family—having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.﻿There is no complete agreement among the students about whether we should take part-time jobs. Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, there are also a lot of students with a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think that they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can prepare them for jobs in the future. Second, they can acquire money on their own, cultivating their independence and skills. Finally, they can meet and interact with a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in school. In contrast, the people who take the second view think that it's not suitable for students to have part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being distracted from the knowledge that they should gain in school. If they are distracted, they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. Thus, it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on a part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try to have a part-time job without putting all our time and energy into it.﻿Nowadays, more and more college students think it is of great value and necessity to get a part-time job. For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for the following reasons. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning money. What values more is the experience you get to enhance your abilities and skills such as communication, independence, problem-solving, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from a part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity for getting involved in society and forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are also adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay in. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time to the extent that you may feel stressed. Thus, you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life.﻿I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are reasons why a part-time job is important. First, it can improve our abilities which cannot be learned in class, like communicating with each other. Second, every company that you want to apply to consider real job experiences as a very important thing. So when interviewing, you will gain advantages over other people by owning a part-time job. Further, a part time job is really a preparation for one's future professional job. However, as a college student, the study of textbooks seems very important, and we have to take all kinds of tests. Doing a part-time job may have a negative effect on the score of tests, and may cause very serious impacts. If your scores are low, you may even lose the ability to graduate from school. Working at a part time job may influence you to see the negative side of our society, eventually causing a negative effect on your mind. Thus, I think it is very important to balance our part-time jobs with our university life. Getting high scores while doing a part-time job is a task that not everyone can achieve. As such, we should give up the part-time job at a certain point.﻿Today, more and more college students tend to have a part-time job. Is this good or bad? As far as I am concerned, it depends on the time you spend in doing it. If you spend a proper amount of time on it, you can benefit a lot from it. Firstly, having a part-time job can enrich the student's social experiences. He will meet all kinds of people in his job and during this period, he will learn how to deal with them. This can improve his ability in communicating with others. What's more, it's not until a student makes money by himself that he learns that acquiring a living is not an easy task. In this case, he will be more understanding towards his parents and learn to manage his money properly. However, having a part-time job also has disadvantages if you spend too much time on it. Having a job means that our studying time can't be guaranteed. For us students, studying is our major duty. Once you have a part-time job, the problems in your job might prevent you from being fully absorbed in your major studies. Thus, just as each coin has two sides, taking up a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. It's all up to you whether you can really learn something from it.﻿What are college students doing at school? Studying. Yes! But many would say that they are doing part-time jobs at the same time. Of course, it is of great importance! Evidently, most of us students are adults now. As an adult, it will be shameful for us to ask our parents for money. To be financially independent is the perfect way to claim that we are independent individuals now, that we are no longer kids under the protection of our parents! Secondly, and also most importantly, having a part-time job allows you to be involved in society. It allows you to find out what the people outside of school look like, how they behave, and how hard it is for us to make money to support ourselves. After going through all of the difficulties that we will encounter, we will gain a lot of experiences. When we graduate and when we next step into society, we will be confident that we are already well-prepared and that we can do it. Thus, we will learn that money is not easy to earn and that our parents are great. We ought to respect them and appreciate what they have done for us. I'm sure we will be more mature and more considerate to others. Working at part-time jobs is a way to see what life really means. Get ready to have a part-time job and try your best to prevent it from having a bad effect on your studies, and then you will be pleasantly surprised!﻿Whether it is important to have a part-time job is a hot topic for college students to argue. Different people have different views. Some students advocate the idea for several reasons. One reason is that we college students should be responsible for ourselves, and a part-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money, so that we would not have to ask our parents for allowances. It can also relieve the financial pressure of our parents. Another reason is that through a part-time job, we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will be good for us to prepare for our future jobs. As the competition is fiercer in society, the more experience you have, the more chances you will have to succeed. However, other students are against this idea. They hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on studying. Working at a part-time job will require much of our time and energy. The life and property security of a part-time worker are also not well-protected by the law. From my own perspective, as we enter university and gain more free time, it is important for us to choose how to use our free time. We should make the most of it and be the master of it. From my own experience, I am working in a restaurant in my free time, and I am happy to have the job.﻿I totally approve of the point that it’s important for college students to have a part-time job. As current college students, we should take an active part in the part-time job, if we accomplish our studying tasks first. With the constant development of the economy and society, everyone, including students, is faced with great challenges. Many students who graduate from university cannot find a satisfying job. They also suffer from great pressure. Having a part-time job can benefit students who will enter into society to some extent. First of all, students can improve their other abilities through the work experience. Moreover, they can familiarize themselves with the society in depth. Besides, students are informed of the fact that society isn't favorable to everyone. Those who long for great success and an enjoyable career must exert themselves to study hard. In this sense, students are alerted about the hardship through the part-time job. Take me for example: I once worked as a waitress in a small hotel. During this period, I had to serve customers and take their orders. I served dishes and rice for them, and I was rather tired during these days. Though the pay was low, I was excited. I learned that everyone should spare no efforts to do something if they hunger for a better life in society. I will commit myself to studying hard. All in all, there are important advantages for college students to do a part-time job during their time in university.",
    "﻿As we know, smoking is not only harmful to people's health but also harmful to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as cancer of the lung and so on. So it is very important and necessary to stop people from smoking in public places, especially in all restaurants. There are two reasons for that. The first one is that restaurants are public places where people have meals, so keeping the air clean is the duty of everyone. Smoking can generate dirty smoke to pollute the surrounding air. There are a lot of harmful substances in the smoke; it is no doubt that harmful substances will stick on food and then they will be eaten by people. So you can imagine how unhealthy the food will be. I think no one would like this environment when eating. Secondly and more seriously, the people who sit around the smokers have to breathe second-hand smoke, which is more harmful to their health than smoking is to the health of smokers. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. The ratio of second-hand smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So smokers should think more about other people, and should not maintain their habits over others' health. All in all, I agree with the government in banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country.﻿I somewhat disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. As is well known, smoking is a killer of humans' health, does great harm to our respiration systems, and finally makes our bodies weak. To make matters worse, most healthy people dislike the smell of smoking, which concerns not only the citizens but also the whole impression of the restaurant. So we could safely come to the conclusion that smoking is harmful to everyone eager for health and honor, except for the factories making cigars and  the like. However, even though smoking is hateful, we'd better say that we should try to control it rather than ban it, or we would be subjective. For one thing, some people here couldn't give it up right away, for smoking is the comfort in their lives. It's possible that if one could live longer without happiness, one might prefer to choose a shorter life with happiness. Thus, we shouldn't take away people's happiness at the moment until we find something else to replace it with and they are willing to accept it. For another, restaurants are places where citizens experience life and relax themselves. Many are accustomed to smoke there. As we see, having a smoke in an ordinary restaurant is like a function of the restaurant itself. From the above, we come to understand that smoking should not be completely banned in restaurants in the country. Instead, we might try to find other ways to improve the environment in which we live. For example, there could be restaurants and other public places made especially for smoking, where you could smoke as you like without any limitation.﻿Smoking is a popular activity among human beings, especially men. But as we all know, cigarettes contain some poison. Many countries have banned smoking at public places. It's not enough; smoking should be stopped not only in public places but also in restaurants in the country. Scientists have proven that cigarettes have nicotine. It's a kind of poison. People who smoke for a long time may get nicotine poisoning, and if it's very serious, they will die because of it. Further, people who always smoke can also get lung cancer. It can't be cured. Patients suffer unimaginable pain. Thus, to maintain or improve human beings' health, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. Smoking is not only bad for smokers, but also unhealthy for the people around them. When one person is smoking, the people around him may get second-hand smoke. The second-hand smoke also contains nicotine and is also harmful to humans' bodies. We can see that if people smoke in a restaurant, everyone in the restaurant will be harmed by them. As far as I know, smoking also pollutes the environment. The smoke it produces will pollute our atmosphere. So if we can ban smoking, we will save our world. I don't know why people invented smoking, but I know why people should stop smoking. In other words, smoking is bad for our health and also harmful for our world. Banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country is a little step. One day we will stop smoking all over the world!﻿Nowadays, there still exist many uncivilized behaviors in public such as smoking, spitting, and littering. I believe that smoking recklessly in public especially does harm both to the health of the people and the environment. As such, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in public. The following reasons support my argument. Undoubtedly, the banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there will be less second-hand smoke released into the air, and people will have fewer chances of being exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, a non-smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good moods. This will obviously promote cultural and ideological progress by forbidding bad manners and developing good ones. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring for others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to society, why not do it? All of the aforementioned reasons tell us the advantages of the banning. It is time to take the advice of banning and to put special emphasis on the improvement of our public environment, though it is a little harsh to the smokers.﻿Imagine that you are enjoying your delicious meal when clouds of smoke surround you and a heavy smoker, whose breath smells of tobacco, speaks out right beside you. How will you feel at this moment? How will you feel about this place? You would certainly lose your appetite and intend to escape from the man as soon as possible, wouldn’t you? For me, I think that under no circumstances should smoking be allowed in public places, such as the restaurant. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smokers and the second-hand smokers are risking their health, even their lives, on cigarettes. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious and that it is our duty to value it. Therefore, stay away from cigarettes not only for yourself but also for others around you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others is bad manners; it not only makes an awful impression on others' minds but also misleads children in regarding it as an acceptable or even cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in public places. In other words, let's create a smoke-free atmosphere to enjoy our meal. Seriously speaking, no smoking at any restaurant in the country!﻿On the whole, I don't think smoking should be banned through the legal system. It should be a choice of the restaurant owner. Then I would foresee that most restaurants would become non-smoking, or at least a few would still keep ashtrays on the tables. However, what if I am a restaurant owner, especially when I am a school restaurant manager? You know, all the restaurants in Wuhan University do not give permission for people to smoke, but I still see people smoking. I would be strict about banning smoking. Now I will give you my reasons. A person like me who does not smoke also have the right not to smoke, I mean, second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking, including lung cancer and respiratory diseases. The famous website Wikipedia lists several million words about the bad effects of passive smoking. According to some experts, the effects of passive smoking are even worse than those of first-hand smoking. What's worse, the smoke causes horrible effects on pregnant women and little babies. Thus, considering our country's future, I am strongly against smoking. Restaurants are places for eating, for satisfying your appetite, so at least in some degree eating can substitute the desire for smoking. It might be easier to forget smoking, especially for smoking addicts. Thus, smoking should be banned in restaurants, especially in school restaurants.﻿According to the Chinese government's announcement, smoking will be completely banned at all of the restaurants in the country on Jan. 1, 2011. People have been discussing heatedly whether this ban should go into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial. However, for smokers, it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, many customers, who spend much money in going to restaurants, just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time there, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second-hand smokers. On one hand, burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxins that are hazardous to life, among which nicotine is the largest killer that can greatly increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smokers experience psychological harm as well. When they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety can increase. Finally, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the littering of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, no smoking, no crying! Taking all of the factors into account, I stick to the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants in the country.﻿It is very common to see men smoking in restaurants in China. If you fall into the habit of smoking, it will be very hard for you to unlearn it. As is known to all, smoking really does harm to our health. Cigarettes contain a lot of nicotine, which are harmful. Many heavy smokers get lung cancer after having smoked for a period of time. Smoking not only does harm to the smoker himself, but also has a bad effect on the health of the people around. This is called \"second-hand smoking,\" and it is very harmful to the public’s health. In the restaurant, when people are having meals, if other people smoke around them, their health will be affected. Smoking also influences the moods of people nearby. If someone is smoking in a restaurant when we are eating, we will feel annoyed and lose our appetite. Therefore, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country, but of course can be allowed somewhere else. Our government should do something to support this suggestion, such as implementing some laws and rules. More importantly, we ourselves should try our best to obey the laws and rules. Then the health of our people will improve greatly.﻿The argument of whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country has been under heated discussion. I will show the different opinions below. Those who are in favor of the idea claim that we all know that cigarettes contain many harmful materials that can cause lung cancer or other incurable diseases. As such, it is very harmful to smoke. On the one hand, smokers will waste a lot of money on buying cigarettes. On the other hand, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and the people who smell second-hand smoke. Further, there are also many examples of people who have suffered from diseases owing to smoking too much. Thus, for the benefit of smokers themselves and other people, it is a wise choice to ban smoking in restaurants. Those who are opposed to the ban hold that smoking is a personal habit just like some people’s habits of reading or running. As such, others have no right to interfere. Besides, a restaurant is a place for people to eat meals and relax in, so smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. As far as I am concerned, my favor goes to the former opinion. If the policy is successfully implemented, we can enjoy our meals in a healthy environment.﻿I am partly for the perspective that all the restaurants in the country should prohibit smoking. As you know, a restaurant is the place where people have their meals. The most important thing for a restaurant is to keep the environment clean and the dishes tidy. If the guests smoke in the restaurant, he or she will probably pollute the surroundings. Worse still, they might drop cigarette ash on the tables or the dishes. Accordingly, it is necessary for every restaurant to prevent people from smoking. Only in this way can we have a better environment for our meals in the restaurants. However, there are possibly some bad effects from this ban. On the one hand, smoking is the sign of a man. The relationship between smoking and men is as important as that between make-up and women. Thus, a man at a restaurant, especially during the time of dinner, seems to be superior to others. They may feel that smoking is representative of their social status. On the other hand, people like businessmen sometimes smoke at restaurants in order to cope with some difficulties and carry out negotiations smoothly. All in all, I partly agree with the point of view of banning smoking totally at all the restaurants in our country."

    "﻿Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Yes, it should. Some smokers may feel that their freedom to smoke will be limited, but smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, may give rise to some problems. It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. According to some international surveys, the number of people who die of cancers related to smoking has increased rapidly over the years. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also that of second-hand smokers. The ban on smoking at all the restaurants can certainly reduce the effects of second-hand smoking. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke has been rising rapidly. Instead of telling the children that it is not a good habit to smoke, the non-smoking signs in restaurants can lead the children to recognize the dangers more easily. Of course, it is of great significance for a successful restaurant to keep a clean and comfortable atmosphere. Customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to smoke in restaurants. How can a restaurant provide satisfactory service to its customers when the customers feel a sense of not being at home? After all, restaurants are public places in which to eat and enjoy ourselves. Smoke can easily affect the quality of a restaurant's services. Given these reasons, we can now draw the conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary.﻿Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is important to ban smoking at restaurants and that we should not allow this condition in restaurants anymore. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to smokers and others in the meantime. Although some people are addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the health of others in public. Moreover, it is commonly believed that smoking destroys the elegant atmosphere in the restaurant. Non-smokers don't want to get harmed by cigarette smoke in restaurants. They come to the restaurants to have meals in happiness. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. In summary, taking many factors into consideration, I hope that this phenomenon will disappear after the struggles of so many people. Besides, our government had better take actions to protect the environment at restaurants and solve the problem as soon as possible.﻿With more importance being attached to health, people are beginning to search for different ways to stay healthy. Of course, as stress from people's daily life increases more and more, the number of people who smoke increases as well. Nonetheless, there is a problem concerning whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, it is needed. First, smoking causes many deaths from lung cancers. Second-hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also a bad example for teens and young adults, as it shows that it is okay to smoke. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Whether there is a non-smoking section or a smoking section does nothing. The smoke still spreads throughout the restaurant. Some people are sensitive to cigarette smoke. Further, smoking doesn't just cause damage to other people’s health, it is smelly as well. People who are non-smokers do not want to smell like smoke. Thus, this ban must be implemented. A non-smoking person should be able to sit down in a restaurant and not inhale unhealthy smoke while they eat. If people want to smoke, they can go outside, or if the restaurant is smart enough, it would create a whole new room that is separate from the non-smokers. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Nowadays, there has been a heated discussion about whether smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. People who smoke argue that the ban takes away their freedom. However, nonsmokers advocate it as a good rule. From my perspective, I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking, which will bring many diseases, does harm to our health. Besides, smoking releases much smoke into the air, which pollutes our environment. What's more, many people cannot put up with the smoke, which makes them sick. It is not surprising that banning smoking in all restaurants will promote workers’ efficiency. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to us to ban smoking in all restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he can smoke in private. My suggestion is that they should give up smoking. It is beneficial to both our health and the environment. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Only in this way can we breathe fresher air in the future! Today, more and more people all over the world want to give up smoking. If you're not a smoker, don't start. In fact, smoking is a bad habit, which causes great harm to people's health.﻿Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? About this ban, different people hold different views. Some people agree and some people don't agree with it. In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There are a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking. What's more, some of them are addicted to it. They can't live without it, so they will smoke in public places such as restaurants. However, nonsmokers hate it; they hate to smell the smoke. They even complain that they are inhaling second-hand smoke in restaurants, which would do great harm to their health. Therefore, smoking is really harmful to people in restaurants. It will also affect people's appetite. I hate those who smoke in the restaurant. Firstly, it does harm to everyone. Secondly, I think it is an irresponsible behavior. Last but not least, it can pollute the clean air. Nowadays, more and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can lead to lung cancer and heart problems. Some smokers have also decided to give up smoking. Some of them also think that the law banning smoking can encourage them to give up smoking. Above all, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.﻿Smoking has been a serious problem for too long a period. In the whole country, measures have been carried out to prohibit smoking in many public places, such as restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, I'm definitely in favor of this rule. What has been taken into consideration in this rule is first and foremost the health of people. Smoking has been criticized for decades. As is so often pointed out, smoking for a long time is likely to result in lung cancer. However, there are certain quantities of people who just cannot give up the \"terrific\" feeling of having a cigarette, even though they are clearly aware that they are risking their health. It's not other people's business if they only smoke alone, but when they're smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, more concerns should be taken into consideration. Numerous statistics show that \"second-hand\" smoking is more harmful than smoking directly. Therefore, when a person is enjoying his/her cigarette in restaurants, where people may not be able to stay away from the smoking immediately, s/he is putting the people around her/him in danger, including those who never lay their hands on a cigarette. So, it is reasonable to ban this behavior that is done in no regard of other people. In the second place, the smog and smell produced by cigarettes may make people feel uncomfortable. Usually, a popular restaurant is crowded with people, which has already decreased the quality of the atmosphere in these places. If the smog given out by cigarettes adds to it, many people can barely enjoy their dishes. Besides, the smell is also not pleasant to those who don't smoke at all. Take myself as an example; I can't help sneezing even from a slight smell of a burning cigarette. It's definitely a catastrophe to me if I have to put up with the smog during my dinner. In conclusion, I'm fully convinced that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country.﻿Despite the fact that smoking does harm to our health, as is known by almost everyone, there are still many people who keep smoking every day. They often light a cigarette in any place they like, especially in public situations, such as restaurants and so on. I feel really uncomfortable while a person is smoking close to me. Accordingly, I suggest that smoking should be mainly banned at all restaurants in the country. The reasons are as follows. First of all, as is mentioned above, smoking is really harmful to smokers' health and that of the people around them as well. A number of research reports indicate that heavy smoking is likely to lead to lung cancer, which is a deadly disease for human beings. Banning smoking at restaurants is an effective way to control people’s smoking habits more or less. What's more, if there is no one smoking at restaurants, other customers can enjoy their meals with pleasure in a comfortable environment. In this way, customers may feel relaxed and have good appetites, which will stimulate the income of restaurants. Nevertheless, if some smokers can't bear this rule, we can set up a smoking room for them to smoke in. This room must be sealed in case other customers will be troubled by the smoke. These are my general ideas of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. I can safely draw the conclusion that this decision will bring us more good than harm, so we should appeal to our friends to support it.﻿It is universally recognized that smoking does much damage to human health and that second-hand smoking causes even more serious effects to the people around smokers. According to the statistics shown in newspapers, about five percent of deaths are related to second-hand smoking. Due to the terrible effects of public smoking, I hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in any public restaurants across the country. By doing so, one of the most important favorable effects is that diseases related to smoking, such as lung cancer, can be cut down significantly. The ban contributes a lot to the creation of a healthy dining environment for people who frequently eat outside, which takes up a large proportion of the whole population. Secondly, prohibiting smoking in some public areas contributes greatly to the development of social culture and ideology. Like drunken driving, which poses threats to citizens' safety, smoking in public does harm to others' health. Such behavior is against our goal of establishing a harmonious society. In addition, the forceful act of a complete ban raises the awareness of the harm of smoking among the general public. More and more smokers will gradually get rid of this bad habit for the interest of their own health. To conclude, it is high time for us to take strong measures to put an end to this smoking era. A complete change to the legal system regarding the smoking issue is necessary for the final settlement of this social problem.﻿People’s manners in public are a good way to show the quality of the people in a country; hence, smoking, which produces a bad influence on the environment and our health, should be completely banned at all restaurants to keep up good manners. Smoking does great damage to the health of smokers and the people around them; for example, second-hand smoke greatly influences the consumers while they’re having dinner. Moreover, a place that is full of smoke would damage the dinner atmosphere and have a bad effect on the consumers' feelings. Thus, from both the consumers’ and the restaurants’ sides, smoking should be completely banned. Besides, as we all know, the behaviors in public decide the quality of the people in the country. If smoking isn't banned in restaurants, the image and quality of the Chinese will be misunderstood. Our country has become stronger and more powerful within these years, and so the quality of the people should be improved by the efforts of all of us. However, the government and the restaurants should also learn from the experiences of the 2010 Shanghai EXPO. We can build some places for smoking, or just set a room for the smokers, as this is a concern for them. Thus, smoking should be banned, but we should also spare some room for the smokers.﻿Smoking is widely believed to be a bad habit which will have an impact on both the smoker and the people around the smoker. In restaurants where people come to relax and feel refreshed, smoking, the selfish behavior that ruins people's appetite, raises health concerns and shows disrespect, should be completely banned. Smoking should be banned in restaurants since it ruins people's appetite. Scientific research has shown that when people say they love a dish, 70% of their joy comes from the smell of the dish instead of the taste of the dish, which means that although the food in a restaurant tastes extremely good, the smell of cigarettes can easily get mixed up with the smell of the food and ruin people's appetites. Smoking also leads to health concerns, which is why it should be banned in restaurants. People are all aware of the danger that smoking may bring. However, the danger of second-hand smoke is even worse. Smoking in restaurants is forcing so many people around the smokers to take in the second-hand smoke, which may lead to public health issues. It is not one person that the smoker has influenced but close to a hundred. For the sake of health concerns, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. Finally, smoking in restaurants is disrespectful. In a restaurant, when a smoker is talking to his company with a cigarette in his hand, he is likely to puff the smoke right in front of his company's face. More than that, the smoke would rise and go anywhere without permission. Further, smoking in restaurants is an insult to the chef, as it suggests that the chef’s food can't satisfy them but cigarettes can. Smoking in restaurants is totally inappropriate and easily affects many people. This behavior should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",
    "﻿Nowadays, many college students take part in part-time jobs. Some people think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. As for me, I don’t think that it is a good idea. To have a part-time job is not as important as making a great achievement in your studies. Having a part-time job means that you won't have enough time to study. As a result of this, the quality of education will decline, and many students will not be able to absorb enough professional knowledge that would be suitable for future work. Meanwhile, as many students will earn extra money from their part-time jobs, they will get into the habit of spending their money unwisely. Since they have worked hard to earn money, they will think that they deserve a luxurious life instead of studying after working for a whole day. How can a tired student study hard in his or her lessons? In other words, the disadvantages of having a part-time job for a college student outweigh the advantages. We can't only focus on the working experience of students. Instead, gaining knowledge of the professional field is more important when we are still students. Thus, we should try to pay more attention to our studies now rather than working at some part-time jobs.﻿The question of whether college students should take part-time jobs has aroused great public concern. As far as I'm concerned, I’m for the idea, as a part-time job plays an increasingly important role in college life. Nevertheless, several people argue that it is a waste of time to take a part-time job. Naturally, they think that college students ought to put more emphasis on their studies. In addition, a part-time job not only takes up much of their free time but also means little to them. On the contrary, others think that it is acceptable, reasonable, and beneficial to take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it is undeniable that college students can accumulate certain experiences through part-time jobs. Then, as a result of doing the part-time jobs, they can earn some pocket money to reduce their parents' financial burdens. What's more, admittedly, if students carry out some more work during their free time, they will find that life is not so dull and that they can do something meaningful to enjoy their college life. In other words, from my perspective, a part-time job, to some extent, is indispensable to our college life. Regardless of other people's ideas, I support my own opinion and believe that it is essential for college students to take a part-time job.﻿Previous arguments have always focused on the necessity of college students having a part-time job. With higher levels of awareness of the benefits of having a part-time job, more people are encouraging their children to acquire one during university. In today's society, a part-time job is becoming necessary in a college student's life. Money is needed now more than ever. A number of teenagers are entering the workforce. The modern times in which we live accommodate the need of teenagers to have their own source of income. A part-time job not only enables students to promote their abilities, but also helps them to apply their knowledge into practice. Furthermore, students who have part-time jobs can relieve the financial burdens of their parents. Studies should remain the main focus of students, but if they have the chance, they should earn some money and gain experience while they're in school. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situations. The most important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time jobs and their studies. Taking advantage of a part-time job during college is practical. Thus, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, if they can handle it properly.﻿Today, an increasing number of college students have part-time jobs. Have you ever taken a part-time job? There are many advantages for us from taking part-time jobs. Firstly, part-time jobs help us keep up with the outside world. We can gain working experience and become more independent. Besides, it's a good chance for us to put what we have learned at college into practice. Through part-time jobs, we can prepare ourselves for our future jobs. What's more, we can make money to pay for everything that we want. Alternatively, it can help relieve our family’s financial burden. However, there are also many disadvantages. If we have part-time jobs, they are likely to distract us from studying. We may spend too much time and energy on working. For example, we may lose the time needed for sleep, rest, studying, club activities, and recreation. It may thus be harmful to our health. In my opinion, college students should have the right attitude when it comes to part-time jobs. Although part-time jobs can open a window for us to learn about society, we must keep a balance between the job and our studies! However, I do think I should pay more attention to my academic studies.﻿Nowadays, more and more college students work at part-time jobs in their spare time as salesmen, waiters, or shop assistants. They are engaged in part-time jobs because they want to earn some money to help their family with tuition fees. In the meantime, they also gain work experience. People wonder whether it is good for students to do so. Some people are afraid that taking a part-time job will require too much of the students’ time, that it will influence their studies. Some people disagree with them. They think that it will be a good way for young students to know how hard it is to earn money and to gain experience from it. To have a part-time job is a hot topic today. In my view, I agree with the latter opinion for several reasons. First, students can earn some money from the part-time jobs to help their family. Second, they can learn a lot from it, and get the chance to show how much they have learned from school. Last but not least, a part-time job can train their ability to work, cooperate, and get along with others. In other words, getting a part-time job is not only good for earning money but also good for studying and improving abilities! Thus, if you have the chance, try to get a part-time job.﻿Nowadays, there's a growing trend for college students to have a part-time job, such as tutors, waiters, teacher assistants, etc. Some people think that it is good for students to gain some practical experiences through a part-time job, while others argue that it's purely a waste of time. However, the question of whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job is quite complex, at least to me. There are certain advantages for a part-time job. As has so often been emphasized, the theoretical knowledge that we've learned in class should be applied into practice. Having a part-time job is an ideal method to increase one's practical skills and expand one’s social network during college. Besides, a part-time job can be a stimulus for students to study harder. Through working, one may find what one lacks in terms of skills or knowledge, compared to an experienced employee. Thus, in order to have a better career after graduation, one may have a better idea of one’s goals for studying and achieve greater progress. Moreover, students who have a part-time job may become independent earlier than those who don't, for they may obtain a clear view of money through earning it on their own. However, the disadvantages should not be neglected. Having a part-time job may occupy too much time, which leaves little time for studying. Instead of acting as a stimulus, in this case, the part-time job becomes an obstacle. Such cases should be taken into consideration since they happen all the time when there's a big project at work for one to conduct. Lacking the ability of time management can make the situation even worse. In conclusion, whether a part-time job is important to a student depends on the work load of the job as well as the ability of the student. There's no easy way to answer this question.﻿Nowadays, more and more students tend to have a part-time job in their leisure time so that they can earn some pocket money by themselves. Different people have various opinions about this issue. Some people think that it is the golden chance for college students to put their knowledge into practice by themselves, while others believe that it is a waste of time to do a part-time job. As for me, I feel that a part-time job does more good than harm. Generally speaking, it's important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, a part-time job will provide more social experience. Those who have a part-time job are more likely to get in touch with various people in society. They can learn how to get along with different people and solve a problem in a short time. It's not hard for us to find that the students with a part-time job are more active and efficient in both their studies and their work. In addition, a part-time job will show them the significance of cooperation. If students would like to work at a part-time job, they must talk to their workmates and cooperate with them. Their habit of cooperation will also play an important role in teamwork on campus. However, on the other hand, if one spends so much time on a part-time job that it affects one’s study, then one should decrease the time spent on working or give it up, for our main duty at present is to study well, not to earn money. In other words, a part-time job is really beneficial to us, so let's take an active part in it!﻿Just like the old saying, “one coin has two sides,” a part-time job can bring us some convenience and money, and expand our social experience, but it can also waste our time, scatter our concentration, and may eventually influence our grades in university. For me, I think the bad effects of a part-time job outweigh the advantages, and it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job wastes our academic and free time. University is a place to study the latest knowledge and to try to get involved in many fields, such as those outside of our own majors. However, a part-time job would take up most of our time, and if we cannot use our time in university more efficiently, we would lose the opportunity to improve ourselves both physically and emotionally. There are some other ways to make money and fulfill our social experience, apart from part-time jobs. For the students who are in great need of money to get through their university, a part-time job isn't the only method. They can ask for some funding and scholarship from their school, or apply to be a TA. Thus, we can find some academic ways to make money. Besides, an internship is a better way to get social experience. Further, a part-time job would scatter our focus from campus life. For example, if we get a part-time job as a tutor for high school students, we must prepare for the classes and travel to the classrooms or the students' houses. All of these things will bother us and disrupt our peaceful campus life. To sum up, a part-time job isn't important and necessary for college students. What we do in university will determine the path of our whole life, and obviously we should make better use of this period.﻿Personally, I believe that a part-time job is necessary and enormously helpful for college students, especially for junior or senior students. By undertaking a part-time job, we can gain at least three major advantages. First and foremost, through certain kinds of part-time jobs, our knowledge fields are extended and our horizons are broadened. For instance, if a student majoring in engineering works as a marketing intern during his vacation, he can gain more knowledge in business management. Such practice is of much significance to the overall development of a future talent. Secondly, the experience of internship helps students a lot in dealing with various cases and communicating with people from all areas. Staying at school, students interact frequently with fellow students and professors, but they are only a small part of the whole society. By going out of the school and immersing ourselves within a complex enterprise, we are urged to approach and meet our supervisor and boss, who are usually successful and competent in their own fields. They can be good mentors for our future career development. In addition, by working part-time, students can earn some money, which alleviates the financial burden of their family. College students are mature enough to be financially independent. To sum up, taking a part-time job benefits students on many levels, and it must be a good choice for us when arranging our holiday schedules.﻿The desire of supporting oneself is luring more and more college students to take part-time jobs outside of school, which has gradually become a trend throughout campus. Young people at this age have the need to prove that they are mature enough and can live on their own. However, when more college students are stepping out of the campus looking for real life, they don't realize that the temptations outside, the damage to their imagination, and the time and energy that they will need to devote to a job may actually jeopardize their minds. One of the disadvantages of taking part-time jobs during college is that students may be tempted by the material world. Different from campus life where everyone is the same, in the real world people are divided into different levels. College students, being somewhat egoistic and ambitious, would soon be tempted by power and social status and forget that they are still students. Moreover, beautiful clothes, delicious food, and luxurious cars can easily attract students' attention and lead them to chase after material things. One possible result is that students won't be able to sit in the classroom and focus on their subjects anymore, let alone spend years working on their research. In addition, taking part-time jobs would influence students to become more realistic and would take away their imaginations. While college students are dreaming of developing new technology and changing the world, business people in society are caring about how much profit they can make out of their investments. Students having experienced the real world tend to consider so much more than others, including money, advertising, and possibilities, etc. Gradually, their imaginations would be damaged. Then, we will only have a bunch of engineers instead of scientists. After all, students' priority is studying. Since taking a part-time job may mess with students' minds, ruin their imaginations, and waste their time and energy, students should not take the risk. Jobs will always be there. College students do not need to be in such a hurry to find employment."

    "﻿I agree with the preceding statement. This is because, I think that college students need a lot of money. I have two reasons for this. First, they should buy many books and read them. They can study a lot of things from the many books. If they go to the library, they can read many books, but they are forbidden from writing in the books from the library. I think writing in books for studying is very important. Therefore, college students need a lot of money to buy a lot of books. Second, they need to make many friends. To make a friend, they should belong to a club. On the club activities, they will need a lot of money. If they get friends, they can enjoy eating and drinking with their friends. On summer vacation, they can plan to have a trip overseas. I think college students need to study and play. A part-time job gives them not only the money but also the wonderful experiences. It is a  very precious thing working in society, and finding out various things. For example, they feel the importance of being responsible for their work and difficulty with getting money. I think college students should have a part-time job, and study a lot of things.﻿I agree with it. I have three reasons to support my answer. Firstly, I think we should have a part-time job to learn how work before being employed in a company. We go to a university to learn many things before being employed and we have a lot of  time to do something after classes. We can choose whether we have a part-time job to learn how work or not. So we should have it. Secondly, I suppose we should know how hard earning is. I did not know that earning money to live is really hard until I had part-time job for which I could thank my parents. I think it is important for us to know how hard earning is and to thank our parents. Thirdly, we can use payments from  a part-time job to do many things for experience. As I said we have a lot of time in a university and we can do something for ourselves using payments from our part-time job. For example, we can go travel and see the world, buy books, organize a student conference and so on. I think that experiences will help us after we graduate. So I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because we can learn how work, we can know how hard earning is and we can get good experiences thanks to a part-time job.﻿I disagree with that. To be sure, to have a part-time to live is vital for college students. But it isn't good to earn money for play. Generally speaking, college students have more free time than high school students and junior high school students. How to use their time all depends on them. Many college students spend a lot of time working part-time because they need to earn money to play with friends. Making many friends in college is good, however, but studying is also important. In college, there are many things to do, for example, taking part in an internship, a club, a seminar, and so on. So, college students should actively challenge how much they can do in college. By challenging themselves a lot, they are able to do their best with confidence when they work in the future. Wages of a part-time job are very low generally, and working part-time is very tiring for college students. So, it costs them a lot of time and effort to get money by working part-time. As a result, they can't often concentrate on a class and study for a test in college. It is not good for them. Therefore, I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree that college students should have a part-time job. There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by holding a part-time job, they can find that earning money is very hard. Because of this, they will think seriously about how they use their money. College students have a lot of free time. If they want to travel abroad, they can make money by working in part-time job. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work full-time. Secondly, if they have a part-time job, they can meet people from a variety of generations, from children to senior adults. Through this, they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they work in a part-time job, the more they are rewarded. For example, their salary per hour may be increased. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can learn their most suitable future job such as teaching children, serving customers in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers, and they teach junior high school students while they are studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. Responsibility is an important thing to learn for when they work full-time. As above, they can learn society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students should have a part-time job.﻿I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree. First, college students need a lot of money. They must pay college fees. They also need to buy clothes, and to eat and drink in order to be sociable. They should not force their parents to pay a lot for them. They should pay the costs by themselves, so they should have a part-time job. Second, they can make friends when they work. By working together, they will become friendly. It is very good to have many friends. For example, when a student has a problem, he or she can ask their work friends for advice. Their advice might be different from college friends’ advice. It is important to hear many kinds of advice. Finally, a student is able to practice for their future job by having a part-time job. If they have not had a part-time job, they don't know what kind of job is good for them. To have a part-time job is a good chance to what kind of job is good for a student’s future. Some people might say that students can study more if they don't have a part-time job. This is true, but I think it is more important to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job will make a student a better person. This is why I agree with the statement.﻿I agree the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because I think that college students need to have the skills to work in adult society. Today, part-time jobs have spread to many areas of industry and have become important roles in these areas. Many companies want young people to work as part-time workers, so we who are college students, young men and women, have more chance to experience the difficulties of working in adult society. For example, I am working in Kobetsukan, a private school with lessons similar to those in a formal school, as a part-time worker. That is my first job as a job to make money and teaches me about the realities of being a worker in adult society. In the private school, I am called Mr/Ms NARUSAWA, and students see me as a professional teacher, but I cannot judge whether this is true or not. When I was seen as a professional worker, I could learn the meaning of working in adult society. It is that I have to play a role as the character other people expect me to. That I knew the mean is the biggest mean for working as a part-time job.﻿I agree with this idea I think college students should have some part-time jobs. I also think they should study hard while they are students. They must live well between part-time jobs and study. This is not because college students need much money. If they have a part-time job, they will have many friends and meet many different ways of thinking. I think there are two types of part-time job. The first one is a job in a juku (cram school). If you have a part-time job in a juku, you must have your own students. You have to study, too. Your previous study is useful. The second type of part-time job is a job in a store. If you work as a shop clerk, you must communicate with a lot of customers. Your communication ability will improve. You will have a lot of responsibility. It is hard to continue a part-time job, but responsibility is needed in society. You will have to have responsibility for everything you do when you become an adult. If you have a part-time job, your perspective will be broad. Before you start life in society, you should practice communicating with many other people and learn how to survive in society.﻿I disagree with this opinion. I think part-time jobs are not necessary for college students. First, college students must study hard. It is very important for college students to study. I think that a student is a person who studies academically or is educated, not someone who works. If a student thinks that their study is finished when their classes are finished, they are wrong. Study is not limited. Second, I think that college students, whether or not they have a part-time job now, will graduate and be working about four years later. After all, college students will have to work in the future, so they should not work now. Third, working is very hard and takes up a lot of time. A man said that one hour for a college or university student is worth ten years to an old man. Actually, the period which is spent in college or university is very important. Students must spend this time seriously. Fourth, there are a lot of things for students to do apart from study. Club activities may benefit college students. Club activities teach a lot of things that are not taught in education. College student should spend a lot of time in these activities, not working. I think part-time jobs are not necessary for college students.﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, if students have a part-time job, they can learn how they work in society. They will have to work when they graduate from college, so I think they should have time to prepare for working in society. Second, if they work in various situations, they will learn how to communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate from college, so they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become employees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the main thing that they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money, so I think they should work during summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it will enrich their life.﻿I agree with this statement, because having a part-time job is very important to learn about our society. My opinion is that it is important for high school students to study many subjects, such as math, English, science, Japanese, society, etc. Therefore, high school students should not work a part-time job. But college students must work after graduating from college, so while they are college students they should learn about working. Because of this, I think they should have a part-time job. If they have a part-time job, they can get some money. In addition, they can learn the difficulty and the importance of earning money. By getting some money they can travel extensively and go abroad to learn about other countries’ culture, leisure activities, language and clothing, etc. But they must not work too much, since their aim, as students, is to learn a lot of technical knowledge. I think they should not work more than four times a week, because working four times a week is more than half of the week. My conclusion is that college students should have a part-time job, but their main activity should be studying, so they must not work too much.",
    "﻿I agree with the preceding statement. First, smoking is bad for one’s health. Those who like smoking will disagree, but smoking causes harm to all people, including non-smokers. People from the elderly to children all go to restaurants. At restaurants, people enjoy eating and talking. If people smoke in the restaurant, other people may think the food isn't delicious. They might have a sore throat and be unable to enjoy talking. I think that a restaurant must be a place that is comfortable for all people. In addition, completely banning smoking helps to stop smoking and improve people’s health. If the number of places that forbid smoking increases, smokers should put up with smoking a long time. Today, many restaurants in Japan separate the seats that allow smoking from the seats that forbid smoking. However, if we sit in the seats that forbid smoking, I feel uncomfortable because of smoke in the air. This is because the restaurant isn't perfect isolated. If someone says that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, their reason will be that smokers would feel uncomfortable. One thing that I suggest is setting up smoking rooms in restaurants. It is completely private room, several seat in the room. I think we set up the smoking room in the restaurant, smokers can be satisfied, too.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country and I have three reasons to support my answer. First, I don't think we need to smoke in restaurants, because we go there to enjoy good dishes, not to smoke. Our purpose is not smoking. Second, I'd like to say that we can't enjoy the taste of dishes when we smoke, because the flavor of smoke is really stronger than dishes. I think we can't have a good lunch or dinner even if we go to a restaurant to enjoy dishes. Third, smoking is not good for health of the non-smokers who come to a restaurant. Non-smokers must breathe smoke when someone smokes in a restaurant, even if they don’t want to. Non-smokers must lose their chance to have a good lunch or dinner because of smoking. And smoke is not good for our health and taste of dishes, especially for growing children. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Because we don't go to a restaurant to smoke, we can't enjoy dishes when smoke is present and smoke is not good for the health of non-smokers, especially children.﻿I agree with the statement. To be sure, we can smoke anytime and anywhere, but smoking should be banned at public places such as restaurants. As you know, smoking is not good for our health. Generally speaking, people who smoke in daily life become sick often. For example, smokers are apt to get cancer. In fact, there is a lot of data that a number of smokers are impacted by cancer. In addition to this, the health of surrounding people is also influenced by cigarette smoke. Smoke causes illness in other people who are exposed to it. Moreover, smoke smells very bad and makes people who are near a smoker feel bad. In a restaurant, guests would like to have a good time by eating delicious dishes in comfort. However, they can't do that near smokers because smoke makes them uncomfortable. There are a lot of restaurants that set aside a space in which people can smoke. It is a very good idea and very nice for non-smokers, but I don't fully agree with the idea because people who sit beside the border between smoking and non-smoking areas are annoyed. For these reasons, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, many people go to the restaurant at lunch time and dinner time. Restaurants are the place where many kinds of people are. Smoke does their health harm. Many families with children go to the restaurant at dinner. Children are more strongly affected by tobacco smoke than adults, and research has revealed that people exposed to secondhand smoke are more harmed than smokers themselves. Secondly, if some people smoke while the other people are having meals, people who are not smokers can't taste their meals very much because of the smoke. Thirdly, students, such as junior high school students and senior high school students, often go to restaurants. If they see people smoke at the time, they could be affected by this become interested in smoking. In spite of being under 20, they could begin to smoke. Lastly, in these days, there are restaurants that people can enter with their pets, for example, dog cafés. Not only to humans but also to dogs, smoking may do harm. This is why I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree. First, people who smoke everyday often suffer from poor health. For example, they might feel tired all the time and even develop cancer. If this happens to you, you can't live with happiness. It is a very serious problem. To live healthy is the most important thing. Second, people around smokers feel bad, and they also suffer bad effects. The smell of cigarette smoke is bad for non-smokers. They can't fully enjoy eating dinner. In addition, second-hand smoke is more dangerous for non-smokers than first-hand smoke is for smokers. It is a more serious problem than the first or second problems. Finally, some smokers’ manners are bad. For example, after smoking, some people throw their butts on the ground. It is also a serious problem for other people. Some people might say that people in developing countries get money from making cigarettes. This is true. If we ban smoking, their jobs will not be needed. However, a job making someone’s health bad is the worst job. Smoking is dangerous, and is completely bad. It is better to buy things other than cigarettes. It is good for you, and other people. This is why I agree with the statement.﻿I agree with the statement: smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I don't agree with the statement that smoking is a personal habit. For example, smoking is the worst. Smoking damages not only a smoker’s body but also the bodies of people around the smoker. This effect is called “secondhand smoke”. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that moves from a smoker to other persons around the smoker. Allowing secondhand smoke to affect others is bad manners, especially in crowded common areas such as parks, stations, airports and streets, because this smoke causes health problems such as asthma and lung cancer in others. Lung cancer is the worst sickness. This sickness's mortality rate is high and a lot of Japanese people have been killed by it. Smoking has a strong relationship to lung cancer, and many scientists think that smoking causes lung cancer. So I think smoking should be completely banned in places where many people are.\n\n﻿I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't like smoking but I think smokers want to smoke when they go to the restaurant to eat or drink something. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers will have little place to smoke. Then, smokers can't smoke anywhere. I think it’s better to have some place in restaurants in which smokers can smoke. However, I dislike cigarette smoke and there are small children and babies in restaurants, so I want to completely separate the seats of smokers from the seats of nonsmokers. Recently, companies or department stores, for example, have smoking rooms. Smokers can smoke only in the room. I think this is a very good trend. Smokers can smoke in the room and nonsmokers are protected from smoke. Smoking is very bad not only for smokers’ health but also for nonsmokers’ health. Nowadays, there is also a cigarette tax. The number of places where smokers can smoke is getting smaller and smaller. Therefore, I hope that the number of smokers will gradually decrease. Now, a price of cigarettes is a little higher than before. Some smokers will begin to give up smoking to save money.﻿I disagree with this opinion. Smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. First, a restaurant is a place in which people not only eat food but also relax. In my experience, I have relaxed at restaurant by talking with my friends and sleeping. Some people relax by smoking. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, they cannot relax at restaurants. Business at restaurants will decrease. Second, smoking does not always cause trouble. Actually, some people don't like others smoking. But establishing separate smoking areas will solve the problem. It enables those who want to smoke to smoke and those who don’t want to smoke to avoid others smoking. Third, I think there is no merit to banning smoking at all restaurants in Japan. All problems about smoking, except about health, are sufficiently addressed by establishing separate smoking areas, and what need is there to do more? Nothing is needed. But more needs to be done in establishing separate smoking areas. We have to be more careful to divide smoking areas, not to ban smoking. What can be done at restaurant is limited. I agree that smoking should be banned in other public areas in Japan, but not in restaurants. Smoking is not only the problem in restaurants.﻿I don't like smoking, so I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, it is true that smoking causes serious damage not only to smokers but also to people near smokers. People who smoke get lung cancer more frequently than people who don't smoke. Second, I think the most serious problem is that smoking at a restaurant makes people who don't smoke feel very uncomfortable. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are the times that all people enjoy eating and relaxing, and a restaurant is the place where people enjoy eating and relaxing. At the same time, however, a restaurant is not a private place but a public place. Perhaps some people relax when they smoke, but I think that smoking in a restaurant is bad manners. For the enjoyment of all the people, everyone should stop smoking. Therefore, all the restaurants should make a rule that bans smoking. If people want to smoke, they should go outside and enjoy smoking. These days smoking is banned in more places day by day. I think it is good, encouraging all of the people to make a comfortable environment and promoting good health.﻿I agree with this statement without thinking. I dislike smoking for the reasons that it smells bad and is dirty. Smoking is very bad for the smoker's health and is troublesome to other people. Restaurants are mainly places for eating, so smoking around people who are eating is very bad for the atmosphere, as well as the smell and taste of the food. It is important for the dish to taste good, have a good smell, and for the atmosphere to be good. Tobacco has a bad smell which is harmful for humans and a smoke which is a white and grey gas. There are many children in restaurants. Tobacco smoke is very bad for children. Moreover, tobacco smoke soaks through children’s clothes. If someone smokes in a restaurant, we cannot wear new clothes. We must be aware of this. Smokers should stop smoking in restaurants as early as they can, and they will be healthy in the future. If they die early because of smoking, their family will be very sad. They will regret that he didn’t stop smoking. Therefore, people who smoke tobacco should stop smoking in the restaurant, and I think that smoking in a restaurant should be a crime."

    "﻿I agree this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I think the best way to learn about money and society is to have a part-time job. In having a part-time job, college students learn about money and society and understand how difficult it is to earn money. College students also learn about  society which is not in school. More and more college students have a part-time job, they are able to prepare for their future life when they will work for their families. If college students don't have a part-time job and don't know what life is, they will have great difficulty in working. During college years, managers don't blame college students heavily if they make a mistake. But in a company, managers blame them heavily. To get used to work and earn money, college students need to have a part-time job. College students need to have a part-time job to know what a life is. So I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job.﻿I disagree with that opinion. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two main reasons. The first reason is that students should study. What students have to do is study, but some students can't study enough because of their part-time job. For example, my friend has a part-time job teaching English to elementary school students. She is so busy everyday preparing for teaching. She often checks their answers to examinations even during classes at  university. Also, she is likely to be late for a class because she has to prepare for teaching all night. I don't think it is good for her. In that case, her part-time job prevents her from studying. The second reason is that many students spend most of their salary playing, not living. They mainly spend their money on clothes, their hobby, dating, traveling and so on. This means that most of them don't work for a living. For instance, my friend who I stated above is one such student. She lives with her family and doesn't have to work. However, she wants to get more clothes and to follow fashion. In closing, I don't want to say students must not have a part-time job, but it is not so important for them. Therefore, I think it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons to support my stance. Firstly, a part-time job is an important chance to experience society. Because a college is the place to prepare before going to the real society, a part-time job is very necessary to know how severe working is or how we may enjoy it. In my experience, I learned that even one mistake cannot be allowed in service through working in bakery. I also noticed the importance of the relationship with my seniors. The second reason is to solve a monetary problem. I think college students need a lot of money for texts or for some entertainment. However, we are already adults and should not totally depend on our parents for finance. Therefore it is better to earn by ourselves as much as possible. As for me, I can live without working if I could ask my parents to support me but I chose to work. This is because I have to learn how to manage myself before graduating university. After I started to work, I actually began to understand the importance of money when I buy something. Lastly, I think a part-time job is a good opportunity to get new friends. In a college, it is difficult to find so many kinds of friends because ages and departments are limited. However, if we work, we can meet many kinds of people regardless of ages or location. I think such relationships are precious even after getting older. For all those reasons, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.﻿I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, I have a part-time job. A part-time job can be a valuable experience. Many high school students are banned from having a part-time job. Even if they want to work, their parents and teachers ban them from doing it. Yet, college students are free to have one  and have a lot of time. They should have a part-time job unless they are absent from classes because of it. Through a part-time job, I learned the difficulty of earning. Therefore, I learned to use money very carefully. This is an important thing in my life. Some people who did not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty until they get a job. Then it is too late. People are not apt to forget things which they learned when they were young. My mother said it is very valuable for young people to have trouble. So, we should experience many things and get a correct view, the right way to think and so on. Those who acquired these will live comfortably as a result. A great life waits for them.﻿I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. The first, is that many college students don't have money but they need a lot of money for their food, clothing and shelter, playing with theirs friends, going anywhere and buying anything that they want. Yet, when they use their money to buy something, theirs parents don't always give some money to them. So they need to have a part-time job. By the working they can get some money, also experience selling products and services and learn the difficulties in earning money. This is the first reason. The second reason is that the wages for college students are cheaper than other workers. So if college students work part time, many companies and shops can hire them without paying higher wages to employees.  Now the condition of business is very bad in Japan. Some people think that because college students work part-time, many unemployed people miss their opportunities to work and so the unemployment rate is high. Certainly the population of the workforce does contain a number of college students and the part-time work done by college students causes the rise in the unemployment rate. Yet it is said that business in the world is the worst for a hundred year so when business gets good the unemployed people now will be able to get work and the unemployed people will be fewer than now. By college students working part-time, many companies and shops can decreased the payment of employees wage. So I agree with the statement.﻿I agree with this statement. Now I am in the third year of university. When I entered the university, I had to have a part-time job because I needed money. If I do not work, I cannot have fun in my college life. For example, drinking, travelling, buying clothes would be impossible. If you want to enjoy your college life, money is really one of the essential things. That is why it is very important for college students to have a part- time job. By the way, I am sure that you can gain and learn a lot of things if you have a part-time job. In a part-time job, you can meet lots of kinds of people, for example other university students and regular workers. By communicating with such kinds of people, you can learn and be stimulated by them and possibly make friends with them. You can also experience the first stage of social work. When you are in third year, you usually go job hunting. If you work at a part-time job, you can talk with regular workers and see the real work place and also notice the difficulty of working there. For that reason, experiencing a part-time job can help you job hunt. That is why I strongly believe that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I want to explain the two reasons why I think that college students should have a part time job. The first reason is that college students should really know the value and difficulties of getting money. People need money to live. A lot of money is needed for one person to be self-sufficient. Basically, college students depend on their parents, especially for money. But most students don't know how hard their parents work to earn enough money for their children. I think they should know how hard work is needed to get just a little money through a part-time job, as their parents have learned. The second reason is that college students can learn about social interaction through part-time jobs. Common sense as an employee is really essential for business, for instance, how to communicate with other people in business and how to talk. A part time job could be only one place that students can learn about society as working adults. Student can communicate with colleagues in their part time job to learn these skills. For these two reasons, I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree with this statement. I think having a part-time job is important for college students. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, thanks to part-time jobs, students can earn money by themselves. For ordinary families, college fees are very expensive. And if students are living alone, much money is needed. So by having part-time jobs, they can help their families. Moreover, even for students from rich families, earning money is important because by using that money they can do many things. For example, they can travel or study abroad. So, in this way, having a part-time job is beneficial for college students. Secondly, thanks to part-time jobs, students will have social experiences that they never learn in school. For example, in food stores or restaurants, they are taught manners and how to speak to customers politely. Such skills will be useful after they become working adults. Moreover, they can learn how hard working is. It is said that these days young people soon quit their jobs, but if they know about the reality of working before they graduate from college, they can persist even if their work is hard. Therefore, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons why I think this. First, they need money. It costs a lot of money to enter a university. Of course, it is not the students but their parents that paid the money. I believe that students should pay back the money more or less to their parents, and some students want to go to graduate school. In addition, generally, college students spend a lot of money. For example, they spend money on buying nice clothes or shoes, hanging out with their friends and participating in club activities. For another reason, through working, they can learn how the society is. A part-time job teaches them how to make good relationships with other team members and their boss. They attain various kinds of skills and learn how strict and severe rules are. They will also learn how difficult it is to make money. You may say that if you work too hard in your part-time job, it causes bad effects on your study in university. This is true, but, actually, students have the ability to control their own shifts to some extent. If they want to earn a lot of money in a short time, they should work as a cram school teacher. Besides, I have a lot of friends who work really hard and get great school records. That is why having a part-time job is necessary for college students.﻿I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons to agree with this idea. First, a part-time job is good training for real work for college students. College students have to work after they graduate from their college. Then, experience from their part-time jobs will help them. For example, if they work in an office, they can learn computer skills. Second, part-time jobs also give students social experiences. Students learn how they should act in society. For example, if the students work as waiters or waitresses, they can learn polite expressions and good manners. This will help them when they are given a job interview. And, of course, in the company, politeness and manners are also very important. Third, most student work in part-time jobs so they can earn money. They can use that money as they want. For some students, that is the first money they earn all by themselves. They can learn the value of the money they use, too. They can also learn how hard it is to earn money and live in the future. For these reasons, I think that having a part-time job is important for college students.",
    "﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Today, because of health problems and high costs, more and more Japanese don't smoke. In Japan, many public places have made smoking illegal and many people hate smoking, so smokers have difficulty in living. If smokers have to stop smoking and don't know what to do, they have great difficulty in smoking at the restaurants. When smokers want to smoke a cigarette and they realize that smoking is forbidden, they are heavily disappointed. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, smokers won't make trouble at restaurants for people who don't smoke. I think the best way for Japan is to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. In doing so, smokers will learn that smoking is not good for other people. In college years, people don't judge smokers harshly if they smoke. But in society, people judge smokers harshly. For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons: health problems and manners. First, smoking causes health problems. Smoking isn't good not only for a smoker's health but also for other people's health. If a smoker has disease like cancer in his lungs because of smoking, it is his responsibility. However, if a person who doesn't smoke develops lung cancer, he will want to find out why this happened. Of course, we can't know that all lung disease is caused by smokers, but there is possibility to develop lung disease in the future when someone smokes at a restaurant. Second, it is a matter of manners not to smoke in public spaces in today's Japan. Smoking makes a lot of people feel bad, so not smoking in public spaces is good manners. But, do we have to ban smoking? There is a good example. You will not do your makeup in a train because it is bad manners and it makes many people feel bad. But some people do makeup in a train even though they know it is bad manners. It is same as smoking. If we don't ban smoking clearly, some people will smoke at a restaurant in spite of knowing that many people hate it. For these two reasons, I think that smoking has to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I strongly support the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, not only because I hate the smell of tobacco, but also because it is bad for the health of all the people in a restaurant. I have 3 reasons mainly. Firstly, because tobacco smoke smells so bad for non-smokers, it is very irritating to endure it. Even though some restaurants have the smoking seats, smoke comes into the non-smoking area and disturb us when we are trying to enjoy the food. I always get a headache when I smell tobacco smoke, and I feel like leaving soon, even when the food is delicious. As long as smoking causes harm to others in public spaces, it should not be allowed at all. The next reason is the cost of restaurants. Because there are a lot of people who hate the smoking, restaurants have to separate the area to get customers. However, as I mentioned before, it is very difficult to separate completely and cost too much if they use high-tech solutions like air curtains. It is much better to prohibit smoking itself in all restaurants because it can be fairer with no difference between restaurants. Lastly, even for smokers, smoking in restaurants should be banned. That is because smokers cannot stop smoking by themselves but it is sure they should reduce their tobacco intake for their own health. Actually, restaurants or coffee shops are the best place for them to smoke in their daily life. If smoking is banned, surely they have to endure their cravings until they come home or they find smoking space in a station or some other space. Therefore, it can be of benefit even to smokers in a long term aspect. For these reasons, I think we should ban smoking completely at all restaurants.﻿I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Certainly, smoking is bad for one’s health. There is scientific evidence and everyone knows this fact. Above all, non-smokers dislike smoking. Though I do not smoke, we have a choice whether we smoke or not. We have a right to do things freely. Many smokers may relieve stress by smoking. I would feel sorry for them if smoking was banned, because they would lose their way to relieve stress. Smoking is banned in public. Now, in Japan some restaurants have smoking seats and non-smoking seats, and others have only non-smoking seats. If smoking is banned more, people will smoke only their houses. Non-smoking areas are increased this way. But, recently cigarettes have been sold not only at tobacconists but also at convenience stores. In fact, tax on cigarettes helps the Japanese government. Nevertheless, banning smoking in many places is a mistake. It is not only smokers who are bad. The Japanese government has the responsibility to solve a problem. Though it is a very difficult issue, it is not natural that only smokers are blamed. Also, non-smokers have to try to be patient and understand smokers, and smokers have to be careful about their manners when they smoke.﻿I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Certainly, many people who don't smoke don't want to eat next to smokers. I agree with this thinking. But by banning smoking at a restaurant, smokers won’t go there to eat and drink. Banning smoking has two bad effects. First, when smoking is banned at all the restaurants, smokers cannot eat out. Then they can't eat something in their favorite restaurants. It makes them unhappy. And when smokers don't eat in restaurants, the number of guests who comes to restaurants will be less than ever. Then the profit of the restaurant will decrease. I think that this is very inconvenient for the restaurant, so I disagree that smoking should be completely banned. But we should consider people who don't smoke. Therefore, I think that smoking should be partially banned at all the restaurants. Restaurants should have some space where people can smoke and some space where people can not smoke. By doing that, both of non-smokers and smokers can enjoy their meals. So I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, but I agree that it should be partially banned.﻿I agree with this statement. At all of the restaurants I have ever been to there is no wall between smokers’ seats and non-smokers’ seats, so I want to explain about only this kind of restaurants. First of all, I want to explain about one reason. Recently in more and more restaurants, smoking has been completely banned in Japan, however there are still two kinds of seats, smoking and non-smoking, in some restaurants. I am not a smoker, so I will choose the non-smoking seats. But even if I sit in those seats, I often feel bad because of the flowing smell of smoke. The smell of the cigarette is very strong. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, I have heard that secondhand cigarette smoke is much worse than firsthand smoke. That means that smoking has a worse effect on non-smokers at a restaurant than smokers. I think it is unfair for non-smokers. I think smokers should smoke outside of a restaurant or in one smoker's room. It is fair and reasonable. Smoking is bad for your health. I am sure that we have to discuss good or bad points of smoking before thinking about banning smoking at restaurants. That is why I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants all over the world, not only in Japan.﻿I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I would like to show you three reasons. The first reason is that restaurants should be places where you enjoy food, not smoke. Restaurants serve you very nice and special food. You can enjoy beautiful food with all your senses like seeing, smelling and tasting. But smoke can harm this very happy time. You cannot enjoy the appearance of food due to smoke. You cannot savor good smells due to smoke. You might not understand the real taste due to smoke. Cigarette smoke prevents you from enjoying a nice meal. Secondly, I want to mention that most of the people who don't smoke really hate smoke, especially when they have meals. People who don't smoke are more sensitive to smoke and the smell of cigarettes than smokers. Restaurants are different from outside places that can push away smoke and get fresh air. People cannot enjoy their dinner due to smoke. Finally, the third reason is that your smoking can harm other people who want to avoid bad effects on their health. People who are concerned about their health cannot help breathing smoke. For these three reasons, I believe that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants. I have 2 reasons. Firstly, because of the bad smell, people cannot enjoy eating at restaurants. Recently, in most restaurants, smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, but it is impossible to shut out the smoke and bad smell completely. So some people who don't smoke have to endure the bad smell from the smoking area while eating. Because of the smell of smoke, sometimes the smell or taste of food is changed. In order to keep the quality of food and people's rights to enjoy eating, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Secondly, smoke is bad for our health. It causes many kinds of disease, like lung cancer. For smokers it is totally voluntary to take this risk, but non-smokers also have to breathe in smoke at restaurants for the reasons stated above. Moreover, secondhand smoke includes more dangerous substances than firsthand smoke. Especially in restaurants, people often take their babies and children, and smoke has really bad effect for their physical development. We need protect people around smokers from smoke in public spaces. Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan.﻿I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think this because smoking does harm not only to the smoker but also to people around him or her. It goes without saying that smoke is gas. Though we can separate seats, we cannot separate gas. If a smoker sits in a smoking section, and you sit in a non-smoking section near him in a restaurant, the more he smokes, the more smoke you take. In addition, we can reduce the costs and time if smoking is banned. Restaurants will not need to buy and clean ashtrays. You may say that this is too strict for smokers, but if they really want to smoke, they should go to a smoking room that stops the gas from leaking out. I believe this idea sounds very nice for both smokers and non-smokers. And these days, the number of people who smoke is reducing in Japan. The price of smoke is getting higher and higher, and it is troublesome to get even a pack of cigarettes in Japan. Then, how about eliminating cigarettes? They simply do not have any good aspects. They just harm our health. In one of the ways we can help eliminate cigarettes, we can get rid of the smoking sections in restaurants in Japan.﻿I don't think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan. I have some reasons to follow this idea. It is true that smoking hurts humans’ health and cigarette smoke also hurts non-smokers. But, smokers have rights and freedom of choice when it comes to smoking. Only forbidding smoking doesn’t make smokers’ smoking manners better. Of course, non-smokers’ health is really important. Smoking without manners will cause a lot of conflict. I have some ideas to solve this problem. First, distinguish smoking and non-smoking seats more strictly. Almost all restaurants, of course, distinguish them already. But, most restaurants distinguish them only by space. I think that this is not enough. I propose that restaurants separate these places by walls. By doing this, smokers can smoke as they please, and non-smokers don't have to worry about the damage to their health caused by the smoke. It doesn't have to take much tax; only a little will work. Second, increase the tax on cigarettes. If smokers need more money for smoking, they will reduce their smoking a little more, at least, in restaurants. Based on these reasons and solutions, I think it is too strict to say that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.\n\n"

    "﻿I agree with the statement. I think there are two reasons why I agree. First, having a part-time job when we are college students can be a preparation for being a member of society. I have had a part-time job for four years. My part-time job is teaching junior high school students Math and English. I have learned many important things. For example, how to talk with my boss, how to deal with personal information and how to associate with my colleagues. If I didn't have it, I would not have any common knowledge, common sense or friends. I think I grew as an adult compared with when I was a high school student. Second, it is a chance for us to know the importance and value of money. When I received a salary for the first time which was made by myself, I thought that I mustn't waste money. Until I entered college, I used to be bought many things by my parents. It is not too much to say that I didn't know how hard we work to make money. Recently, many college students have a part-time job. I think they also learn many things like me. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree with this opinion. There are some reasons. First, it is important for college students to learn how difficult it is to earn money. If students don't have a part-time job and they only study and enjoy their free time, they never experience the importance of earning money. Second, they can meet a lot of people through a part-time job. In college, people who come  are almost the same age. Probably, there are other college students, or women who have children, or people from other regions etc. These people can know many things that you don't know or you won't learn at your college. So you can learn not only at school but also at the place you work. Third, if you experience many kinds of work through a part-time job, you can learn what work is about. And you can imagine how you want to work. The time that you are college students is only a few years, but you must prepare for the future before you graduate college. So having a part-time job is very important. I think that having a part-time job is as important as studying in college. If students spend much more time on their part-time job and they don't have enough time to study, they should reduce the time that they spend on their part-time job.﻿As a college student, I agree to the statement. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have 3 reasons to support this opinion. Firstly, for students to learn how to manage money. College students don't have much money, but have lots of time so they tend to use it too much. They're not good at controlling it. If they work, they'll recognize the importance and value of money. They're also going to get responsibility for money so they will never waste it. In the near future we college students will have our own family. We will have to manage money all on our own. We should be independent and learn how to control money as soon as possible. Secondly, for students to know society. Now, in university, lots of students are so lazy. Some are always late for school, some often sleep during class and so on. Thanks to having a part-time job, they can know the responsibility for their tasks. There are many differences between college and society. In society, rules are much stricter than college. If they don't know their society at all, they may not be able to be hired because of bad manners. So for students, a part-time job is a  good opportunity to practice for the future. Lastly, for companies to save money. Now in Japan, the economic situation is not good and companies hire fewer people than usual. So they are in trouble because of lack of staff. If companies hire general people, they have to pay a lot of money. But for students, the pay is only about 800 yen per hour. Companies may want to hire students more than general people. In conclusion, I think college students should get a part-time job both for students and for companies. ﻿I agree with this statement, I think that college students should have a part-time job. I have three reasons for this. First, they can learn a lot through having a part-time job, and it will be useful in their future. For example, I worked at a Hotel as a service staff member at the banquet. Through this job I could learn that it is not easy to earn money, and I felt appreciative towards my parents, because they have worked for me since I was born. If I hadn't had a part-time job, I would never get such an understanding. This is just one lesson from my working experience, but I believe every college student can learn something important through doing a job. So in my opinion, college students should have a part-time job. Second, having a part-time job gives them a lot of information about occupations. Then if they have a several kinds of jobs in their university days, they can know what kind of jobs they really want to do in the future. I mean that having a part-time job brings happy lives for college students. Third, I think students have to have a part-time job, and earn money by themselves, because college students need a lot of money for trips, study, or to play with their friends. They should not make their parents pay all of their expenses. They should try to be independent from their parents. So, they have to work in order to earn the money that they need. In conclusion, from these three reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.﻿I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course, college students have to study but study isn't all they have to do. They also have to experience a lot of things before they graduate from  college and begin to work. For example, reading books, listening to music, playing sports, and going on trips. In regards to trips, they can go where they haven't visited, see what they haven't seen and feel something special. College students are not children but also not adults. Time while being a college student is time to experience and feel a lot of things  as they prepare to become perfect adults. For that, they need some money. They have to prepare the money they need by themselves, because they aren't children. Their parents mustn't give them money and they mustn't depend on help from their parents. To use the money they work to get is important. By using money they work to get, they can know the importance of money and ways to use money. That's why they have to have a part-time job.﻿I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is important because they can learn a lot of things through their part-time jobs. For example, if they work in a store, they learn that smiling is very important, and that there are a lot of types of people in society. Part-time work is also important for students because the experiences that they have in their part-time jobs are very useful when they look for what they want to be in the future. They can do various types of part-time jobs, so it helps them to look for what they want to be in the future, and they cannot have a part-time job when they start to work full-time. When they are college students, they have a lot of time to work in a part-time job, but when they start to work full-time, they don't have time to work part-time as well. Part-time jobs are also important for college students because their experiences having a lot of part-time jobs when they were college students will become a good memories in the future. They will enjoy their lives more because of these memories. For these reasons, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because they can learn a lot of things through their part-time jobs.﻿I agree with the statement because part-time jobs gave me lots of experiences. For example, I learned the following things through part-time jobs. It is hard to make money because I have to go to my part-time job on the day and time that I promised, even if I don't want to. I have to be on time because if I am late, I interrupt my colleagues’ jobs and make bad relationships. I can't stay self-centered because guests choose the restaurant which they want to go to, so I need to make them comfortable when they choose my shop. I learned from part-time jobs about the importance of making money and making relationships. But I learned it is tiring to have job at the same time. I need time to rest and recover. So it interrupts my study to have too much work. I agree with having a part-time job but it is better to work during long vacations like summer or spring vacation, because students’ first priority is study and part-time jobs should not interrupt their study.﻿It is important for college students to have part time jobs. I have two reasons why. One reason is to make money. College students have much free time compared with other members of society. Adults often say, “I have money but no time.” As college students, we can do what we want to do as far as time permits. Therefore, we need money. The other reason is to have many opportunities through part time jobs. Part time jobs enable us not only to make money but also to make friends, have a sense of responsibility, learn manners, and so on. As for me, I have had a part time job and worked at a doughnut shop for 3 years. I work from 5:00 to 9:00 and go to school twice or three times a week. Since I started my part time job, I have changed. For example, I come into contact with a wide range of people from children to old people through my part time job. I have learned how to talk with a range of people. This skill has helped me in job interviews. Consequently, I received an informal job offer. In addition, I sometimes travel using the money I have earned. I have been to India, Australia, South Africa, and so on. I had invaluable experiences in these places. I couldn't get such experiences by relying on pocket money from my parents. But there is one thing that I must not forget. The main work for students is not their part time job but study. So students must hold a part time job so that the job doesn't interrupt their study.﻿I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Here are some reasons. First, college students have much more free time than junior high school students and working people. So, college students have to use some time for working. If they have a lot of time, they often use the time for only leisure. If they use it for a part-time job, they may get something good for their life. This is the second reason. College students can learn a lot of things that they can't learn in their college. They can learn, for example, the difficulty of making money, systems in society, and they can also learn gratitude to their parents. Third, I think that college students should be independent of their parents, because college students aren't children; they are almost adults. It is difficult for them to be completely independent from their parents, but it is important to become independent in some ways. One of the points I think is having a part-time job. They should make money that they use for leisure. Even if the money they can earn is only a little, the action can help their parents, I think. Those are the reasons why I think that college students should have a part-time job.﻿I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons. First, college students can learn a lot of things that they don't study at college through working. For example, relationships, skills and manners. I have a part-time job in a Japanese restaurant. The work is very hard, and I often receive advice from colleagues and from my boss. Sometimes I am scolded very badly. I want to quit the job when the boss scolds me, but my colleagues and boss help me when I'm in trouble. In fact, I really thank them because they teach me important things for fitting in with society. I have also become responsible because of my job. I really realize that I have matured through working. It is good for me. Secondly, college students can communicate with many people with whom they can't speak in daily life. In the Japanese restaurant where I work, there are many housewives. I sometimes feel that there is a generation gap, but talking with them is very fun. We talk about raising children and money. They talk about things that I don't know about. It is very interesting for me. I think having a part-time job gives a lot of important social benefits to college students.",
    "﻿I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't think that all Japan’s restaurants should have to ban smoking. I often eat lunch or dinner with my friend who is a smoker. On these occasions, we talk for a long time so he sometimes begins smoking. If all restaurants ban smoking, I will be not able to talk and eat dinner with him. Some people may say he shouldn't smoke when he eats dinner, but it is a matter of freedom for him to smoke. It's his own problem whether he smokes or not. Some people dislike smoking, but others do not. What shall they who don't like cigarette smoke do? Almost all restaurants in Japan have non-smoking seats. People who dislike smoking should use these seats. Then, they would not be interrupted by smoke. In Japan, smoking is not banned. If restaurants ban smoking, they will be troubled by fewer customers, because smokers won't dine at the restaurants. For these reasons, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Ｉdon't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays, almost all restaurants in Japan have two different seats. One is a seat for non-smokers, the other is a seat for smokers. When you go to a restaurant, a waiter surely asks you whether you smoke or not. So if you don't smoke or you hate cigarette smoke, you should choose a seat for non-smokers. However, in the case that you don't smoke but your husband or your friends smoke, they may choose a seat for smokers and you may put up with their smoke. In that case, you should not put up with it. You must say that you want to take a non-smoking seat. If smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, people who like smoking will not be willing to go to restaurant. Because of this, we should not completely ban smoking, but every restaurant should be careful about their internal environment. For example, they should place plants that keep the air fresh, or clean the air sometimes, etc. It is important for restaurants to keep their environment clean. And it is important for people who go to restaurants to say whether they want to smoke or not. For these reasons, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons to support this opinion. The first reason is for health. Under the status quo, in some restaurants, seats are divided into smoking and non-smoking areas. But even if we sit in the non-smoking area, we have to breathe smoke because it flows from one area to another. The smoke raises our risk of getting cancer. This means that it harms not only smokers, but also surrounding people. Tobacco is very bad for our health. When smoking is banned, we don't have to be afraid of breathing smoke and worry about it in the restaurant. Without health, we can't do what we want to do. Health is very important for our life. Smokers must not hurt non-smokers' health. The second reason is for us to enjoy food. Imagine, when you taste delicious food, it smells of tobacco. Then, how do you feel? Of course you pay for the food and you want to taste as much as possible, but you can't. So smoke makes you irritated and you never come to the restaurant again. What's more, the restaurant staff worked hard to cook delicious food for you. It's a very bad situation both for restaurants and customers. Like this, now, we can't fully taste food because of smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, we can always just enjoy having food. We will appreciate for the food and restaurants. It's very good for the relationship between restaurants and customers. I think restaurants should be places where we mainly enjoy eating. So as not to be interrupt our enjoyment of the food, smokers should have to smoke outside. In conclusion, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. This would benefit smokers, non-smokers and restaurant staff.\n\n﻿I agree with this statement. These days, many restaurants in Japan are likely to separate the smoking area from the non-smoking area. However, some of them fail to separate them completely. This means that even if I take a table in the non-smoking area, I may smell the cigarettes from the smoking area. Cigarette smoke makes me uncomfortable, especially when I am having a meal. In my opinion, the solution to this problem is that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Moreover, smoking is bad for our health, and some studies have shown that if people smoke while they are eating, their risk of getting cancer is increased. So, the Japanese government should ban smoking at all restaurants in order to save all citizens' health. From my personal experience, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. One of my friends was able to quit smoking by the increasing number of non-smoking areas. It became harder for her to find areas where smoking is allowed. This made her smoking fewer cigarettes per day, and now she doesn't want to smoke at all anymore. Therefore, since I heard this story, I've believed that policy of smoking being banned in all restaurants makes it easier to quit smoking. That's why I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.﻿I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because restaurants are places where we enjoy special food and conversation with friends, family, or a boyfriend or girlfriend, smoking is not needed there. Smoking in restaurants has two bad effects. One is that smell of smoking is bad for our enjoyment of food. For example, we can't enjoy the smell of foods if there are people who are smoking in the restaurant. Smell is an important part of food. We enjoy foods by not only their taste but also their smell. Smell can make foods good, or otherwise it can make foods bad. The other bad effect is that smoke is bad for one’s health. In restaurants, there are a lot of people: babies, children, teens, adults, and the elderly. Smoking has a bad influence on them all. Smoking is bad for health of all people, especially for babies and pregnant women. Smokers don't have the right to cause health problems for others. Smoking has these two bad effects. That's why I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should consider the enjoyment of the food from that restaurant and health of the people around them.﻿I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because that smokers have the right to do what they want to do, as other people who are not smokers also have this right. Of course, I disagree that smokers should smoke whenever and wherever they want to. And I also disagree that smokers should be smoking when they are walking or working. Some people who think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country may say that smoking is very harmful and bad for the health of the smoker and the people around him, and I think that they are right. In fact, I don't like smokers very much. But I think that completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is too strict for smokers. I also think that a complete smoking ban in restaurants is not fair for smokers. So, I think that at least some spaces where smokers can smoke freely should be made at all the restaurants in the country. This is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree with the statement because I hate smoking while I am eating a meal. Smokers have the right to smoke, but non-smokers also have the right not to smoke at the same time. But the non-smoker's right is lighter than smoker's. Smokers can smoke almost everywhere at any time. Despite the fact that smokers can control their desire for a short time like during class, if they want to smoke, they can go to a smoking place soon after eating a meal. It is hard for a non-smoker to say “don’t smoke” to them, and non-smokers have non-smoking places. Smoking causes many diseases like cancer, heart diseases, etc. Even smokers don't want to have these diseases. They don't want to get sick and are afraid of death after falling ill. But people don't stop smoking. One reason is the Japanese environment. People can get cigarettes easily and cheaply and can smoke almost everywhere. The Japanese government hasn’t forbidden smoking. They don't try to reduce smoking rates or announce that smoking is dangerous for one's health. If smoking was completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers would lose one chance, one place for smoking, and some smokers may quit smoking. It would be evidence that smoking is bad for one's health so the government banned it, and non-smoker could enjoy their meals.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The main reason is that smoking is harmful not only for smokers but also for non-smokers. There are two types of tobacco smoke: firsthand smoke and secondhand smoke. The former is absorbed by smokers and the latter passively by non-smokers. If smokers have bad manners, smoke floats into the air. At first, restaurants are places where people gather and enjoy eating. The food tastes and smells good. If smoke is present in the restaurant, it reduces the dishes’ taste by half. Although people have the freedom to smoke, they may not harm others’ enjoyment of their meals. In fact, smoking has been banned from 10:00 to 14:00 on holidays in the doughnut shop where I work for a year. The is the peak time when people gather. I feel that more families with children come to the shop compared with before. It shows that more people dislike smoking. All people can enjoy meals equally at any time in any place. In Europe, most countries ban smoking in restaurants. Following Europe, it needs to be banned in Japan too.﻿I think that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country for several reasons. Cigarettes have a lot of bad effects on both smokers and non-smokers. First, restaurants are places that everyone enjoys eating and talking with his or her friends. Everyone should be happy in restaurants. Smokers may be happy to smoke. But non-smokers must be not happy, because even if they don't smoke, they have to breathe cigarette smoke. Even there is only one smoking person, the smoke spreads all over the room in restaurants. In my case, I don't like smoke and the smell of cigarettes, so if someone smokes in restaurants, I don't want to eat there. Second, smoking during eating is not good manners. At least during eating, smokers should stop smoking. Non-stop smoking is not only bad manners, but can also become a killer. This means that cigarettes may lead to diseases in both smokers and non-smokers. The disease of particular concern is cancer. Cancer is one of the more difficult diseases, because it often reappears, and if the cancer is too bad, the person may die. As you know from these examples, cigarettes give only bad effects to people. That is why I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree with this opinion for two reasons. First, it is painful for people who don't smoke to have dinner in the restaurant. They often have a worse experience when people are smoking. Some people say, “We don't have to ban smoking in the restaurants. It is enough to make the non-smoking seats.” It may be better than if there were no non-smoking seats, but we can't say it is enough. Because smoke really can go everywhere in the restaurants, people who don't smoke are still exposed to smoke. The managers in restaurants should be more careful for their guests to enjoy having their dinner. Second, smoking makes restaurants dirty. I have a part-time job in a Japanese restaurant and guests can smoke everywhere in the restaurant. After the guests go back home, I clean up the room. Then, I always find that there is a lot of ash on the tatami. It is really hard to clean. I also find the color of walls is getting a little yellow. I can't believe there are people who don't hesitate to make the room dirty. They are guests, but it is natural that they should have good manners."

    "﻿I agree with this. My main reason for agreeing is because smoking is really bad for oneâs health. I have heard that it's poisonous to breathe somebody's smoke. I mean if someone smokes in front of a non-smoker, the non-smoker could be affected sometimes more than the smoker. Some restaurants separate the seats for non-smokers, but the smoke could still reach to non-smokers. In the restaurant, we should enjoy the dishes without smoke. In many countries, smoking in restaurants is not allowed. Japan is too oblivious to the smoking problem. There are no good points to smoking. We have to think about this more seriously. Me, I don't smoke and I really hate smoking. But actually I have many friends who smoke. I can't tell them to stop smoking, although I am worried about their health, as I also know how hard it is to stop smoking and they want to stop if they can. One of my friends who often smokes said that she doesn't know how to stop smoking so she wants some non-poisonous substitute. I don't think smoking should be banned completely everywhere so far because it would be so hard for smokers, but I hope some kind of substitute will be made as she said. What I want to say is that smoking should be banned at least in the restaurants, but not everywhere. We should think not only for non-smokers but also for smokers.﻿I agree with the statement. First of all, I really hate smell of smoke. The smell is very strong and it does not go away until I take a bath and take off my clothes. It is very uncomfortable. Once the smell sticks with me, I have to be with it all day. I can't believe it. Second of all, restaurants are public places. Everyone is in there, including babies and old people who can't protect their bodies strongly. Public places should be safe. Besides, people usually have a good time with family or friends having a delicious meal and enjoying their conversations in a restaurant. Nobody can interrupt their leisure time. Smokers should put up with not smoking in restaurants, because their visit only lasts an hour or more. Last of all, smoking is nothing but poison for smokers and people around smokers. It is so harmful that it causes lung cancer. Now everyone knows it. It is like a crime to smoke in public places; it hurts people, even though the bad effect is invisible at that time. But it is certain that smoking destroys our health, so it is natural that smoking should be banned in public places.﻿I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country in terms of the health of the customers and the benefit of the restaurants. First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking and non-smoking areas are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in the non-smoking area end up receiving the secondhand smoke. It is said that the secondhand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than firsthand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harms customers in both physical and mental ways. Second, smoking does harm to the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed, whether completely or partially. In fact, when I choose a restaurant, I try not to go to restaurants that do not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friends and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers fewer customers than if it banned smoking. This is detrimental to the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely.﻿I agree with this statement because smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants. I'll talk about why smoking is bad for other customers. It's bad for health and enjoying food. As it is known widely, smoking is worse for secondary receivers of its smoke than for smokers themselves. There are many people affected by secondhand smoke, including, of course, children. To avoid the health problem of non-smokers and children, smoking should be banned. In addition, it's bad for eating food. In my case, I cannot enjoy eating if others smoke. I have a terrible headache when I smell smoke. How can I enjoy the food? Even if the smoking zone is separated, I can smell smoke when I go to the bathroom or something like a drink-bar. Then, as I said, I get a headache. It's a good idea to have a separate smoking zone, but it's best to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. And next, I'll tell you why it's bad for restaurants. When I see people who smoke in the restaurant, I always wonder if they enjoy the food. I think they don't. Smells and tastes are diminished by smoking. A restaurant is a place where we enjoy eating and restaurants must think they want customers to enjoy the taste of their food. If restaurants really think this way, they must ban smoking to let customers enjoy their delicious food. Smoking is bad for other customers and for restaurants, so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, smoking should not be banned completely for two reasons. First, a smoker has a right to smoke as long as it doesn't become a nuisance to other members of the public. In the restaurant, if they make some area or tables for smokers, smoking will not trouble other people. In some public place where we can't separate non-smokers from smokers such as sidewalks in a big city or platforms at station during rush hour, I think, of course, we should ban smoking completely. But if we just set the table for smokers, there could be no problem. Actually, at many restaurants they arrange tables for both groups (smokers and non-smokers), and this is considered to be a good idea and seems to have been successful. Second, if smoking were banned completely at all restaurants, smokers would hesitate to go to restaurants. In this situation, the profit of restaurants would decrease and eventually the economy would also be negatively impacted. It is true that the number of smokers is decreasing, but there are still large numbers of people who enjoy smoking. I have a friend who smokes very often. He said that he didn't want to go to a restaurant in which smoking is banned. So, if we shut out those people from restaurants or cafés, there would be a negative impact on the Japanese economy. As I said above, I disagree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan.\n﻿I agree with this idea, mainly because there are many people who don't like smoking. Especially at restaurants, people who don't smoke may think that they want to taste their dishes without being impacted by smoke. Moreover, nowadays the number of people who don't smoke is increasing in Japan. In other words, the number of people who don't want to take their seats near smokers in restaurants is growing. Therefore, restaurants that do not ban smoking may lose their customers who don't smoke. For example, if there are two restaurants, one in which smoking is completely banned to smoke and the other in which smoking is permitted, I will choose the one that completely bans smoking because I hate smoke in restaurants. People who love smoking should go to cigar bars, not to restaurants. Both restaurants and bars can continue to attract their customers. In addition, I think that making smoking and non-smoking areas costs restaurants a lot of money. They must prepare some equipment to divide the two areas and the clerks must spend their time to do so and to ask their customers which area they prefer. To ban smoking is good for both customers and restaurants.﻿I agree with this statement. I have two reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, to ban smoking at all restaurants, people who do not smoke can be guarded from smoke-filled air. Recently in Japan, more and more restaurants have separate smoking and non-smoking sections, and at most restaurants, you can choose the section where you sit. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, there is still high possibility for non-smokers to breathe smoke. For example, non-smokers cannot choose a non-smoking seat if the section is full. In this case, they have to take seats in the smoking section, and they automatically breathe smoke. Also, just separating the sections cannot completely prevent non-smokers from breathing smoke. Even if smoking and non-smoking sections are separate, the two of them are still in the same restaurant. Thus, non-smokers are not perfectly guarded from smoke-filled air. In addition, clerks should also be considered. Even if there are separate smoking and non-smoking sections in a restaurant, it does not help the clerks. Therefore, the clerks cannot be guarded from smoke. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants helps smokers to try to stop smoking. If smoking is not accepted at restaurants, smokers cannot smoke at restaurants. I think it makes smokers think about trying to stop smoking. It is very good for their health to stop smoking. For these two reasons, I agree with this statement.﻿I disagree with the statement. There is a prevailing opinion that since a restaurant is a place to eat, it shouldn't be covered with cigarette smoke, in order not to spoil the food. This opinion sounds valid, but who in the world made a rule that foods should always be eaten in clean places? Actually, this opinion is held by people who do not smoke, who are in the majority. How about the opinions of people who want to smoke while eating? Also, from the point of view of diversity, I think there can be some people who smoke. A world where everyone is behaving the same will just be boring. People smoking look somewhat cool. There's also an opinion referring to the bad effects smoking causes to your health, but I think just a few minutes being exposed to smoke while you eat won't give you a fatal effect, unless you go and eat at restaurants about twenty times a week. But for my real opinion, I don't really care whether people smoke at restaurants or not, because I don't go to restaurants so often. Many people must be the same. There are many cooking books you can buy at bookstores, and you can make meals tasty enough by yourself.﻿I agree with the statement because of the following reasons. First, when we breathe the smoke, we sometimes cough or develop a sore throat. That is a bad thing for us. Second, the smell of smoke is very bad. Some people may think that everyone should tolerate the smell, because smoking gives smokers refreshment like a drink makes people refreshed. So, they think smoking in restaurants is not a bad thing. However, there is a serious problem in smoking: cigarette smoke contains many harmful products like nicotine. Such products are said to cause cancer. Moreover, they harm not only smokers but also people near them. Smoking gives us not so much refreshment as illness. In Japan, smoking seats are separated from non-smoking seats in many restaurants, but they are not completely separated. When we sit in the non-smoking seats, smoke comes into the area and we breathe in harmful substances. That makes no means to separate the seats. Japanese restaurants sometimes have enough space, so I think it difficult to separate them completely. If smoking were banned in every restaurant, we would have no trouble with smoking. So, stores like restaurants should ban smoking.﻿I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm going to write why I think this way by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the situation. Now, imagine that all the restaurants in the country ban smoking. As many of you know, smoking gives us nothing good, especially when it came to medical field. Tobacco smoke contains a lot of chemicals and some of them cause lung cancer. In addition, it has turned out that the smoke does more harm to those who are around the smoker than it does to the smoker himself. Therefore, if there's nobody to smoke in a restaurant, it means that nobody is exposed to the danger of taking the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. I think this is an advantage of banning smoking in restaurants. Some people might want to smoke, even in restaurants. Those people might not come to restaurants as they used to do, since they are never allowed to smoke in the restaurants. Decreasing the number of the customers can affect the financial state of restaurants, and have a negative economic influence. This is a disadvantage of banning smoking in restaurants. It is true that some people can feel that they cannot do without cigarettes. However, I think such people are already addicted to smoking. What they should do is not smoke in a restaurant and risk the health of both other people's and theirs; they should consult their doctor. In the first place, restaurant should be a place where people enjoy their meals. Therefore, I think banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country is really a good idea.",
    "﻿I agree with this statement. In my opinion, there are two big reasons. Firstly, we can get money. College students need a lot of money for many things. For me, it's really important to go out with friends and go shopping, go to stylish cafés, and drink. I can't survive without money from my part time job. Some people get money from their parents, but I don't want to bother my parents. They already pay for my school and rent, it costs a lot. I think I have to earn money for my amusement by myself. Another reason is that we can get valuable experiences. We meet new people and learn about customer service, how difficult or hard it is to get money before we graduate school. I could thank my parents as I knew how to make money and how hard it is. Also, I learned about the service manners which would be useful when I get a job. Of course studying is the most important things for students, but we won't be able to get this kind of experience in university. I think experiences from a part time job is as value as classes in school. That's why I agree with having a part time job.﻿I agree with it. Because they need training to work before they graduate. Studying in college is very different from working in society. If they don't study hard that is a personal problem but if employees don't work hard that is not a personal problem. If they have a part-time job they can learn  a lot. For example: responsibility, hospitability, communication skills, how to solve problems, and so on. They will also quickly get used to working when they have a full-time job as they have experience working. But working in college is not the only thing to do. Of course they need to study and read. If they don't study their college fee is of no use. However a lot of students tend to take their time to work for money that they can use for what they want. They need social training but they have to understand what is important to do now. They can work as much as they want after they graduate. But college life only happens one time for many students. So it is important for college students to have a part time job, and it is also important for them to study. Balance is key to success in their college days.﻿I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job. The reason is that they can learn a lot of things which are very important but which are not taught in schools. For example, they can learn how to build a good relationship between colleagues or their  boss. Whatever part time work you may be doing, it is usual that you need to cooperate with others to work. Through this kind of cooperation, they can learn what is important to make relations with colleagues or bosses better. In my case, I teach English to high school students in a cram school as a part time job. Through the experience of cooperating with other teachers and teaching students, I realized how important it is to mutually communicate with people. Another example is that they can grow a respectable attitude towards money. Through working hard and then getting money as a salary, they may realize that getting money requires hard work and how important money is. This also applies to me. Before I started to work as a part time teacher, I thought that money was something that was given by my parents for free but now I think that money needs labor and time. In conclusion, a part time job can teach many important things to students. Therefore, college students should have a part time job.﻿I agree with this statement because I think they can learn many things which are important after graduating through a part-time job. They can learn what they are good at and how to speak to others. They can understand what they are good at or not. There are some types of part-time job, teaching, delivering, cooking, customer service and so on. Home teacher, for example, is a typical job for college students. Those who have no idea of his/her future may want to be a teacher be being a home teacher. Or, those who want to be a teacher may change his/her dream because he/she realizes him/herself not good at teaching. So it's a good chance for college students to know themselves. Next, it is important to speak politely when we speak to others such as our boss, strangers and so on. When they only spend their time in college, they only speak to friends and they have few chances to speak politely. So in order to learn how to speak to others, it is valuable for college student to have a part-time job. So as I said, they can learn what they can do and how important it is to be polite through a part-time job.﻿I agree with the statement. There are two reasons that I support this opinion. First, part-time jobs are the only opportunity to experience what a job is and how it works, before entering a company. Before entering universities(even after entering them), almost no students have decided what type of jobs they want to do or which company they are interested in. For those students, part-time jobs are good chance to find a job which they truly want to do. Also, in Japan, once we enter a company, it's very difficult to quit the job and to find another job, even if the job is uncomfortable. However, you could have many part-time jobs and quit them easily. I myself have been working in the cram school, and I learned a lot of things. Second, most university students don't receive their allowance from their parents. So, they have to work to earn money for leisure activities, for payment of mobile phones, or dating with their boy/girlfriend. In some clubs whose club dues are high, all members do a part time job as a club activity. For them, part-time jobs are a very important for their daily lives. To conclude, I strongly suggest that university students try to experience part-time jobs as much as possible, as long as they do not become an obstacle to studying.﻿I can't agree with the idea. I think that study is more important for college students than having a part-time job. Of course, if college students could do both equally, it would be best. Yet most of them, at least those around me, can't do so. This is especially true for students from national colleges who are given a lot of money by the country for going to college and studying. Therefore, I think they must study hard to become the people who are capable of doing something. Sometimes I hear the opinion saying things like the following: “College students should have a part-time job because it gives them many experiences to live socially”. I think doing various things is good for young people, too. At the same time, I think it is ridiculous to have part-time job that takes a lot of time when all of the rewards are just money. Seen in the long span, it is better  for college students to study hard about their specialties than spend their precious time on a part-time job. Studying is making their career. If they have to pay their college fees by themselves, they should have a part-time job but, if their parents or country do so, they should have a part-time job to live or to study not to play.﻿I disagree with this statement. I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, students cannot concentrate on their college studies if they have a part-time job. I think that the most important work for students is studying. However, if they have a part-time job, they have to spend a lot of their time on their part-time job. Thus, they tend not to be able to focus on their studies in college. I know some of my friends, who have part-time jobs and spend most of their time on it, almost always take a nap during their classes. This happens because they work hard until mid-night for their part-time jobs and can sleep only four or five hours in the night time. In this example, having a part-time job prevents college students from studying. Secondly, having a part-time job sometimes damages students' health. As I mentioned above, because of their part-time job, some students cannot get enough sleep. This can cause serious damage to their health. Also, their job requires them to work several hours, sometimes seven or eight hours a day, so they tend to lose their regular diet. Therefore, having a part-time job causes serious damage to students' health. Finally, students tend to waste money if they have a part-time job. Although there are a few exceptions, most students are given financial support by their parents. Thus, most students do not have to pay their college fees and other kinds of fees on their own. This means that they can freely spend the money that they earn from their part-time job. Thus, some students tend to buy very expensive things without adequate reflection. For these three reasons, I disagree for the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I think college students should not spend time on part-time jobs. I think college students should do things what they can do only when they are college students, for example, read many books, go for a trip, play sports, take part in club activities, etc. Indeed, you'll have some time for these things after starting to work for a company, but there will be less time. Like many people say, you can work as much as you like after graduating from college. The only problem is that all the money you use for these experiences is earned by your parents, not you, so you must be careful not to waste money and time. You should always keep in mind that time is finite. As long as you think the things you are going to do are necessary for your future, you should do them. So, if are willing to be an owner of a restaurant in the future, having a part time job at a restaurant might be a good experience rather than just reading books about management or food. But, in my opinion, I think students should read books. Reading books on various topics will surely have a positive effect on your future.﻿I agree with the statement. Some people may think that there are disadvantages to students having part-time jobs. These people worry about students spending a lot of time on the job and not having enough time to study. However, I think that their concern is nonsensical because students know the importance of study, and they will study in their free time. I think there is more advantage to having a part-time job than disadvantage because of the following reasons. First, I think that doing a part-time job will help students' parents. Having a part-time job makes students earn extra money. Thanks to that extra money, some poor parents who cannot earn enough money for their child to go to college can send their children to college. Second, having a part-time job makes students develop economic independence from their parents, and they can realize the importance of money. Third, the most important reason I think, it is useful for them to experience working life before they work at a company. If they have a part-time job, they can take responsibility and get many job skills, for example, greeting people, conversation, presentation and so on. So, they will be able to work better than those who have never experienced a job. That's why I think having a part-time job is important for students.﻿I don't agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course there are both good aspects and bad aspects to having a part-time job. I'm going to write why I don't agree with the idea by showing both good aspects and bad aspects of having a part-time job. Let me explain. They say young people can acquire far more things than older people in the same time. If we have a part-time job, we can get some money, and getting money from one's work is surely a good thing. However, we can't actually have what we could have acquired if we had done something other than working. This is a bad aspect of having a part-time job. On the other hand, having a part-time job itself can teach something important to us. For example, through a part-time job, we can realize the value of money, or realize our parents' effort to raise us, know how we can give better service to customers, or encounter many people and enhance our knowledge. Those are the good aspects of having a part-time job, and we cannot do those things by just reading our textbooks or something like that. In my opinion, college students should regard their study as more important than anything else. If we want to experience the good aspects of having a part-time job, I think it is a good idea to have a short term part-time job. However, I think having a part-time job regularly can sometimes affect the quality of college students' learning. Therefore, I think it is better for them to study as much as possible rather than to spend their precious young years, unless they are in a financially difficult state."

    "﻿There are many smokers in the world so non-smokers are damaged by them. They even smoke in public buildings. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for three reasons. First, we can help poor children. Many countries have increased cigarette taxes and also increased prices so there are many people who cannot buy them. We can help by stopping buying cigarettes. In Korea, the cigarette price is 2,700 won. With this money, we can give water, rice, bread and new life to poor children. That is, spending money on more valuable things can help someone. Second, secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. Smokers already know that, however they do not care about others' health, even in their own family. For example, about 600,000 people are killed by secondhand smoking every year. Especially, fetuses are more damaged and harmed directly by smokers. As a result, secondhand smoking can kill people. Lastly, there are many smoking areas in the country. Because the government could not completely ban smokers from smoking, they made many smoking areas. Therefore, smokers keep this policy because it is at the least some concession to non-smokers. In summary, we can help poor children by stopping smoking, smokers can damage non-smokers' health, and there are many smoking areas available, so I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.﻿These days smokers have no consideration for others in restaurants. Smokers don't care about other people in restaurants. It appears that smoking is harmful to other people. Therefore, I really agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because not only is smoking very harmful to smokers' health, but it is more harmful to non-smokers who breathe secondhand smoke. Smoking can lead to various cancers and other diseases. Because of the number of people of all ages in a restaurant, a smoker causes much damage to children, older people, and pregnant women, as well as other people. Passive smoking is more harmful to our health than smoking. Therefore, passive smoking increases the risk of various cancers and other diseases. This makes non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke very angry. Besides, the smell of smoking is terrible, so the taste of food is lost. Restaurants should make smoking rooms. People who smoke cigarettes mustn't smoke in a restaurant. If they want to smoke, they fill the restaurant with smoke and put many people's health at risk. Also, restaurants need restrictions on smokers. Smokers need more consideration for others in restaurants and they must realize that their smoking is harmful to other people's health.﻿Nowadays, many people smoke cigarettes. But most of the smokers are high school students. Smoking is really harmful for teenagers and adults. Cigarettes are bad for your health and are not good mentally. Cigarettes are the cause of various illnesses such as cancers and impotence, and cigarettes smokers know this already. And cigarette smokers give a negative sight. But smoking is not only bad for you. Cigarette smokers can derive joy from it and give a benefit to the nation because the price of the cigarettes includes state tax. And cigarettes also become a favorite food for the smokers. You can choose to smoke if you want. I think to say STOP SMOKING is not a good idea. If the smoker does not give damage for another people, I think we need not to say things like that. We can make a lot of smoking area for the smokers and the non-smokers. I smoke cigarettes too, but my father said it will be good for me to quit smoking cigarettes. I am considering quitting cigarettes. I think if I quit, I can save my money and my health. Thank you for reading my essay and I will study hard in English.﻿I think that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country because tobacco is very injurious to people. In restaurants, people eat food so many people do not like smoking. Moreover, the cleanliness of food is very important to people. In addition, passive smoking causes harm to other people. I want to say three reasons that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, when eating food, people do not like smoking in the restaurant because foods have their own taste and smell. In addition, smell of cigarettes is disturbing to other people. Next, cleanliness of food is very important. Food should always be clean and fresh. Therefore, the taste of the food will be delicious. However, if the neighboring table is smoking, we will think that is annoying and eat out in the restaurant. Last, passive smoking causes damage to other people. Passive smoking is very injurious to people, and its effect are worse than direct smoking.  Eventually, the damage caused by smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also, we must try to do not smoke in restaurants and should try to be considerate of others.﻿I think cigarettes are the worst item in every situation. First, smoking does not look good. A person who is smoking looks like a gangster. Second, cigarettes are not healthy. But if a smoker is smoking I can't scold him only for smoking, because smoking is just his choice. Third, smoking on the road is very important. I have been this situation before. When a smoker is smoking while walking I was behind him. It was disgusting because he blew his cigarette smoke right toward me. In fact, I had never thought about smoking on the road before I went through this situation. But my mind has changed. The smokers who smoke on the road are very rude persons. But now I think just smoking is not right. Surely, if someone is smoking then another person suffers harm. So I can scold them because I am harmed by them. In accordance with these contents, I think all places must have a space for smokers only. Restaurants are not an exception. Besides, a restaurant is a place to eat, but if someone is smoking other people get displeased. So all smokers should be smoking in their place so as not to cause harm to other nonsmokers.﻿I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the world. As someone who hates smoking, smoking should be banned in all public places as well as in the restaurants in the world. Today, a lot of countries have banned smoking in public places, but still a lot of countries haven't banned smoking in public places. I will state reasons why we should ban smoking in restaurants and public places. I have three reasons. First, smoking damages other people. Smoking is a personal freedom, but smoking in restaurants interferes with the freedom of others. Second, smoking is bad for children's education and health. A lot of different people come to restaurants. There are men, women, and children. When a child comes to the restaurant, if the guest sitting next to the child smokes, it is bad for the child's health and education. Finally, other guests receive unpleasant feelings from smoking, especially in restaurants. They eat delicious food, but smell bad smoke. They do not like the smell. Also, they want to get the natural taste of the food. If mixed together with smoke, they can't get the natural taste of the food. For these reasons, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the world.﻿These days, smoking is banned in most public places and buildings. The problem is that there are smoking areas. They banned smoking, but they have smoking areas, which is ironic. Smoking should be banned in public places. Especially at restaurants. First of all, there are non-smokers. Non-smokers don't want to smell cigarette smoke. They are going to eat lunch or supper, not cigarettes. Even if smokers sit in their area, the smell is there, and I would feel like I was eating disgusted garbage. If you eat dinner with a smoker, it is a disaster. Because of the smoker, you will be in the smoking area. Non-smokers have to smell uncomfortable cigarette smoke. In my case, I really hate breathing another person's smoke. Second, smoking causes toxic diseases. As you know, smoking can cause lung cancer And can damage non-smokers' health more than smokers'. Non-smokers just want to enjoy their dinner, but they also receive a bad gift from smokers. Smoking produces all evil and no good. Some smokers say that if people don't like them to smoke, they can leave, but I think it would be better for them to quit smoking. Cigarettes are a kind of drug. I wish smokers would stop smoking.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All people can go to the restaurants, and not all people smoke. There are fewer smokers. Therefore, they cannot smoke at any restaurant. For example, one family visits a restaurant. They are a family of four: father, mother, a boy, and a baby girl. There are many smokers, and smokers are near the family. We cannot defend our health, happiness, and freedom. Maybe, the young boy will learn to smoke from the smokers and the baby will breathe air with smoke from smokers. The young boy and baby could be your son or daughter, so it is very dangerous and makes you angry. Next, some countries use fire on tables, such as Korean soup, Japanese soup, and United Kingdom royal dessert. So, today, in restaurants with these foods, we can see fire on the table. If you smoke in this space, your cigarette ember is near gas. We know smoking near fires is very danger. I think if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers will never smoke in restaurants, and then all people there would feel happy, healthy, and avoid danger.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people smoke in our country. Smoking is really bad for people. I know the smokers cannot stop smoking. It is bad news for them. However, when they smoke at restaurants in the country, non-smoker also breathe smoke through the air. Although a place may be separated into parts, one for smokers and another for non-smokers, the smoke flows through the air. It affects non-smokers, so the law should be made for non-smokers. It is also helpful to smokers. When they want to smoke, if smoking was banned at all the restaurants in the country, they would go outside. This is uncomfortable, and if they work, it makes them really busy. They could not make time to smoke. As time goes by, maybe they would stop smoking. Smoking is really bad for our bodies. If the people want to live healthy lives, they should stop smoking. It should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country and all over the world.﻿Smoking is bad for our health, so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking has been proven to cause all kinds of diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Smokers cause risk to themselves as well as non-smokers with second-hand smoke. Nicotine in tobacco products is extremely addictive, which makes it hard to quit smoking. Smoking damages non-smokers as well as smokers, so smoking should be banned everywhere. Smoking has a harmful effect on our body's skin, organs, and spirit. First, smoking is harmful to our skin. A smoker's skin occurs ages faster than a non-smoker's. Also, smoking makes the skin weak, so smokers recover more slowly from diseases of the skin. Second, smoking is harmful to our organs. Smoking is a typical cause of many diseases and cancer. Scientifically, smoking is very harmful to our lungs. Finally, smoking is hazardous to our spirit because smoking makes smokers dependent on cigarettes. As stated above, it is bad for our health to smoke. Therefore, smoking should be banned everywhere. Also, I think the government should raise the price of cigarettes so that smokers can't buy them.",
    "﻿Nowadays many students have part-time jobs to pay for their college tuition. It's going to be a problem because we have to do it, especially at private schools. I think it is important for us, however there are many disadvantages. First, we are students. The most important thing to us is studying. The chance to have a part-time job is always around you however the chance to study is not always around you. For instance, consider someone who has started studying late. They thought that their part-time job is more important than studying, but they realized that they must study at the appropriate time. Therefore, a part-time job is not more important than studying. Second, we cannot concentrate on class. Generally, we do part-time jobs from the evening to late at night. Therefore, we cannot concentrate in our classes because of sleepiness. For example, I worked for a night delivery service from 10:00pm to 6:00am. It was so hard on the first day, but I adapted to the environmental change so I slept during classes. Therefore, part-time jobs disturb students' concentration in class. Consequently, part-time work has become a social problem. Many news outlets report it as a social problem, so the Government has adopted a wise policy to encourage students to concentrate on their studies. The problem can only be resolved by the Government because it's a hot potato for college students. We have to study for our future and part-time jobs are not our first priority.﻿I agree that college students should have a part-time job. Because if college students have part-time job, they improve socially. College students experience social life early. They improve socially more effectively than students who don't have a part-time job. As a result, these students will get a job and they can adapt more easily. Also, college students earn money themselves without their parents' help. Therefore, they will know that earning money is very hard and they will think that money is precious. They won't easily spend money and their parents' money worries will be reduced. Finally, the reason I agree that college students should have a part-time job is making friends. While they work part-time jobs, they meet many people. They can make many friends and they meet many diverse people, and they will improve their speaking skills. Because speaking skills are very important to their life, improving speaking skills is helpful. For college students, having a part-time job has many benefits. Therefore, college students should experience part-time work. A part-time job related to their major is more effective than an unrelated job. If college students don't disturb their study, their having a part-time job is very good.﻿I think part-time jobs are very good for students. I will write about why. First, we can earn our own money. We can use that for eating, shopping or recreation. I can also help my mother with my university registration fees. Second, it can help us to experience our society. It will help you learn how to conduct yourself at your company and how to face your boss. Also, you can make friends at work. I can save my money for the future and to buy my parents birthday gifts if I save monthly, and not depend on my parents to be grown up. Nowadays university fees are very expensive, too, so that is why students look for part-time jobs. Another reason is society experience. Many people graduate with no social experience, and that can be problem when adjusting to working in a company. To face one's boss, it takes a lot of courage because the boss can fire you at any time. At school we have friends and at work we can make friends too. Making friends at work can help me adapt to work and teach me how to work well. These reasons are why I agree with students' doing part-time jobs.﻿I think having a part-time job is very important, because we are going to gain experience in our part-time job and we will earn much money. But many students think that part-time jobs are more important than studying. Nevertheless, I think that many people are going to have a part-time job. Part-time job experience is to be commended, because a part-time worker meets many people and gains experience. Here are some reasons why students should have a part-time job. First, the part-time job experience is going to teach sociability and allow them to meet many people. Because many part-time jobs are customer-facing these days, sociability is very important. Many customers like to have highly socially-skilled workers. Therefore, many employers choose to have employees with developed social skills. Second, the part-time job is going to earn much money. Many students receive pocket money from their parents, so they haven't any part-time job experience or experience earning money. When they receive earned money, they are going to be pleased. Finally, they get experience of many part-time jobs. These days Korea has many kinds of job, so students are going to get experience. When finding a full-time job, part-time job experience is very important. In conclusion, many students will have part-time jobs. And students study more, so they will survive in a competitive society.﻿I think that college students'part-time jobs are important because of the tuition fees getting higher. Students' parents get in trouble paying all their childrenfs tuition. They find it difficult to afford all the tuition for four years, so most students have the responsibility to help their parents. But if someone who is not rich is thinking \"I don't need to have a part-time job\", then that person doesn't need to have a part-time job because doing a part-time job is optional, not compulsory. But I think that a person going to college should have part-time job for two reasons. First, they can help their parents who find it difficult to pay for their son's or daughter's tuition for four years. Of course, the money they earn can't cover all the tuition, but the money is not only tangible money. It shows care for their parents. And they can use the money they earned their allowance. We can see this as a small thing, but it is a big thing and a source of pride for them. Second, they can go through out of the college. That is important. It is easy to people who go to college thinking \"I'm a just a student\". But college students are not just students. College is one type of small society, so college students are members of society. So I think college students'part-time jobs are important.﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, students can gain social experience with a part-time job. After graduating from school, students will start their social lives. However, if students start social lives without social experience, they will have difficulty. Therefore, having a social life in advance is a good thing. Also, nowadays, when companies hire people, they prefer experienced people. In order to get a job, students need more social experience. Next, the second reason is that they can live without the help of their parents. They can earn money and appreciate their parents. Today, a lot of students need the help of their parents, so a lot of parents help their child. However, when students have a part-time job, they don't need the help of their parents. Finally, they can build friendships. They have to meet a lot of people and talk to them because dealing with people is difficult in social life. People dislike unkind, unfriendly, and rude people, so, they can learn how to act kind and friendly. Although there are a lot of reasons, I think this is the most important reason. For these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿Recently, the biggest issue for college students is tuition. Specifically, it is like a “tuition bomb.” We pay large amounts of money for tuition. Look around; there are many people who get loans. In my opinion, college students having a part-time job is not important. It is dependent on condition. If you are rich enough, you don't have to worry about paying for tuition. If you are not, you must be a part-time worker. You can't afford to pay for tuition, which means you are not rich, so you have to get a loan to attend college. Then you have a debt, and repay it yourself, because you are not child anymore and can't bother your parents to pay tuition. However, there is an exception, which is a scholarship. Theoretically, receiving a scholarship is easy. You can just study hard and participate in a party or festival that you belong to, but my experience, receiving a scholarship for four years is very difficult . So, I have had a part-time job since I was 20. Therefore, if you cannot study hard, and are not rich, you have no choice. You must find a part-time job. So, a part-time job is not important for everyone. It is only important to some.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, college students will look for a nice job after graduation, and they know that when owners need to pick new staff, they usually want people who have experience in another office. Students can gain experience by visiting other countries, working somewhere, and doing an internship. My friend worked for a long time at one company when she was a college student, and then she could get a job there. Second, students always feel that college fees are very expensive. So, they need a lot of money for college life, but they cannot work for a long time or every day because they are students and students have to study. Finally, they can learn the value of money. Today, we live with a richness of everything. If we want something or want to change our telephone or watch, we can get it from parents or somebody else. So, we don't know the value of money. I think that if college students have a part-time job, they will grow into great people and will change their lives, so a part-time job for college students is very important.﻿Is it important for college students to have a part-time job in our country? I agree that it is. Many college students need money for their school life. They want to do a lot, buy a lot of things, and eat a lot of food. However, they do not have enough money to do everything. So, they should earn money. However, they cannot have a full-time job because they are students and the most important thing is to study. So, if they want to work, they should get a part-time job. Of course, parents give money to their child, but it is not enough to keep up with their life. Sometimes, when students work, the business owner does not give them money on the day it's due. So many students cannot get money even though they work hard for it. So, the country should make a law concerning this problem, and the owner should follow this rule when they hire students part-time. In conclusion, a law should be made and the students should work hard to earn money for their life.﻿I think that having a part-time job is important for college students because if we have a part-time job, we can increase our responsibility. Many adults say that students should study hard rather than spending time on part-time jobs. However, I think part-time jobs for college students are good because they can learn the importance of money and responsibility. The first reason is students can gain experience. Working experience is really important for getting a job. Also, students can learn to respect other people. The second reason is students can gain valuable insight about a career. Before I go into my real field of work, I need to learn skills and knowledge of the work place, and I want to see which job really fits me. The last reason is to earn money. Many people who are University students want to get their own money so they can buy pretty clothes and eat good food. However, we shouldn't only concentrate on getting money because we are still students. We have to focus on studying our subjects. Working for money might hinder our focus on studies because it takes a lot of valuable time. I think the best solution is to get money on vacation and study during the semester. I believe having a part-time job is very beneficial for college students."

    "﻿In many countries, smoking is banned in supermarkets, restaurants, hospitals, airplanes, and most forms of public transportation. I'm against all of this. In university, there are so many more smokers than non-smokers. In other words, I disagree with idea of prohibiting smoking in public. So, in my opinion, we don't have to quit smoking. Cigarettes are the smoker's favorite food, just like how someone enjoys the favorite tea or coffee. Just show consideration for non-smokers. For example, smokers should smoke in limited areas. This is common sense. We don't have to quit smoking. But you can get a bad effect to it. First of all, it is dangerous to one's health, and can lead to cancer or other diseases. Second, it can be addictive. And third, it causes the body to smell bad, so many people will keep far away from a smoker. And fourth, there will be much money spent, and it is terribly big amount if it was accumulated. Thus, it is unfair to prohibit smoking in public. If smoking in public is prohibited, the smokers' rights to smoke are ignored. Making a smoking area in public is the best way to respect both smokers and non-smokers. Then, you'd better release to smoke than to quit. Thus, I don't agree with banning smoking.﻿I completely agree with this statement. A variety of groups visit restaurants - kids, juveniles, adults who have quit smoking, old people who don't like the smell of smoke, etc. If kids and juveniles were exposed to smoke or see smoking, smoking is very harmful for them. Some curious kids and juveniles think \"I want to smoke\", and if adults who have quit smoking were to smell the smoke, they may be tempted to smoke again and damage their health. Buying tobacco is expensive, so if smokers were to quit smoking, they would save money and they could spend that money more meaningfully. For example, they could make a donation for Africans who don't have money, food, water, or medicine, and save their life from disease. Or they could spend money on their family household goods. Also tobacco is very addictive - the so-called \"legal drug\". Above all, smoking is very harmful and secondhand smoking is very hazardous for health. I insist that we ban smoking in restaurants. If a smoking ban was not enacted by law, the nation should implement smoking areas. And if they were disobeying the law, the government should punish lawbreakers ruthlessly with considerable penalties including long periods of jail and community service.﻿I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First of all, smokers are more likely to develop cancer. To human cancer, we are experiencing now 30-40 percent of all cancers being caused by tobacco. At least 20 kinds of cigarettes inside the Level A may contain carcinogens. The accumulation of carcinogens in tobacco smoke continuously for long periods, depending on the type of cancer, greatly increases the probability of occurrence of cancer. Currently we are experiencing, among all mankind, 30-40% of cancer being caused by cigarettes. Therefore, if the world did not smoke, 30-40% of all cancers would not have occurred. The second reason is another disease: smoking leads to respiratory diseases. If cigarette smoking continues, respiratory function continues to weaken. As a smoker continues to smoke cigarettes, bronchial wall thickening creates a narrowing of bronchus and weakens respiratory function. For these reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree. First, smoking can threaten the health. As a report states, a cigarette contains more than thousands of  different toxic or poisonous chemicals such as nicotine and carbon dioxide. These chemical ingredients threaten the health, especially that of the lungs. Smoking causes not only smokers but also non-smokers to die. According to a survey, more than 50,000 Americans die from second hand smoke (SHS) every year. Of those, thousands of American non-smokers die from lung cancer. Like this, not only smokers but also SHS could cause lung cancer. Therefore, smoking in public should be prohibited. Second, smoking can make public spaces, especially the university campus, unpleasant environments. A poisonous gas and the harmful content of e cigarettes can pollute the air of public spaces. The campus space must be a safe and pleasant environment for faculty, staff and students. Smoking on campus in public space plays a role in creating an unpleasant environment. According to a survey at Utah State University, about 80% of students would support a policy making the campus completely smoke-free. Smoke in the air pollutes the clean air of campus which is made by trees, and the students find this unpleasant. Smoking in public spaces, especially on campus, should be prohibited.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Ultimately, restaurants are places to offer food. They need to supply fresh food and clean rooms to customers. Of course, people who visit a restaurant want to have dishes in pleasant surroundings. Imagine, when you are eating a delicious meal at a restaurant, smokers are smoking at the next table. Smoke is getting to spread in the air. You should be upset and lose your appetite. It is absolutely bad behavior to smoke in most of places where many people visit. A person who smokes in these areas lacks consideration for others and has no manners. They must know their fault and correct their error. A mature sense of citizenship helps to grow a country. However, it is better to prepare smoking sections for smokers in a lot of restaurant because smokers have a right to have their liberty and personality respected. If smoking is prohibited in restaurants by the law, lots of smokers cannot obediently accept that. Anyway, I am sure that it is a serious social problem. We have to find out the best policy to satisfy both non-smokers and smokers.﻿A lot of people smoke cigarettes everywhere to reduce stress. Of course, it seems to relieve their mind to smoke cigarettes. However, I disagree that smokers may smoke in public places as well as the entire restaurant. I think that smoking should be completely banned at public place in this country. There are some reasons supporting my idea. First, passive smokers are more likely to get cancer compared with non-smokers and smokers. According to a WHO report, passive smokers are always exposed to fatal disease like cancer and they are at risk of getting cancer three times to four times compared with non-smokers and smokers. Second, to smoke cigarettes costs a lot of social expense. The survey of the Ministry of Health and Welfare shows that smoking areas are the most expensive to clean because of time and employees. Third, smoking can cause dangerous accidents like fires. According to the National Emergency Management Agency, fires in restaurants have been caused by carelessly thrown away cigarette butts. As a result, many people are injured by this situation. For these reasons, I absolutely assert that smoking should be banned all places except smoking areas in the country.﻿I totally agree with the idea of Topic B (Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.) Let's see some reasons. First of all, there are lots of people who don't like the smell of smoking. For example, a month ago, I went to a restaurant near a mountain. On one hand, I liked the place because of the air around it; on the other hand, I saw a person who was smoking in the restaurant, and that makes me feel uncomfortable. I really hate the smell of smoking and when I smell it, I get a headache, so it was terrible dinner due to that person. Secondly, secondhand smoking is fatal for people's health. As you know, secondhand smoking is much worse than smoking. Therefore, smoking in public place affects other people who are in public place as well as the smoker Thirdly, there is a possibility of a fire. In this case, many people who are in the public place are going to die. Fourthly, smoking in public places makes young people or children have curiosity about it or makes them want to smoke. That's why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think most people agree, too. Restaurants are public places, not private places. I don't think smoking is bad; smoking in restaurants is bad. Non-smokers are harmed by smokers because of secondhand smoking. I have seen that secondhand smoking is more harmful than smoking in the news. Smoking in restaurants exposes other people to disease. The target could be your own family. Imagine one case; today is a family dinner. Your son sits next to you. You start smoking, and your son breathes your smoke. Your son is non-smoker. What does your son think about you? Maybe he feels shame, because he has a conscience. He thinks your smoking in restaurants is wrong. Don't you agree? Everyone knows smoking in restaurants is not good - child, adult, teenager, or elderly. You must mostly think about people's health. Don't smoke in restaurants only for your pleasure. If you want to smoke during a meal, then go outside and smoke; that is manners. Nowadays almost all restaurants have a smoking room. Your few steps will be other persons' happiness. For most persons' happiness, smoking in restaurants should be banned and smokers must observe this law. That's a win-win strategy for both sides.﻿veryone wants to have a good healthy life without any diseases. One way to keep from having a miserable life is to know what is good and bad for your body, and do not do what is harmful for you. Many people smoke knowing that it can damage their body pretty easily. However, those same people want to have a life with no pain. Those people do not deserve a right to think about an existence without agony. I think it is really absurd. God gave us a mind to think for ourselves, and do what is right for us. Expecting to have a great life while smoking your lungs out is really ridiculous and silly. The main substance that is used in a cigarette is tobacco. First it is burned, then it is inhaled into a person's body. When it settles down and finds a place for itself in the lungs, it forms black holes, which lead to lung cancer. Therefore, I really recommend people stop smoking. You might ask, “why do people sell cigarettes?” Simple: Money. That is the answer; instead of thinking about other people's health, they need the money. However, from the very beginning of your life, safety and health was the most important thing, and it still is. Let's say some people don't really care about their own health, so they think it's okay to smoke, but smoking also harms the people around you. When you inhale smoke, you don't keep it in your lungs; You exhale it back out. Therefore, that smoke can affect other people's lungs too. Smoking is the most popular drug. It is also considered to be addictive. We all don't want to lose our lives like this. Life is the best gift you can get, so let's stop doing what is harmful for our bodies and start caring for them more.﻿I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking is not good for our health. Smoke is made up of various toxic chemical ingredients and is a cause of disease, as well as not being good for health. Also, smoking is especially not good for the lungs. So, it becomes hard to breathe during activities like exercise or singing. Next, non-smoking people in restaurants would become targets of second-hand smoke if we allow smoking in restaurants. I heard that second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoking first-hand. Maybe, there are weak persons such as children, pregnant women, or the elderly in the restaurant. These weaker people never want to breathe second-hand smoke because it is very harmful for them. These days, almost all cafeterias are divided into two places, one for smoking and one for non-smokers. I think dividing space into two places is one good solution but it is hard to have a perfect effect. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, or if there are smoking rooms outside the restaurants.",
    "﻿I'm all for part-time jobs. These days, most students have a part-time job because they can't live on pocket money from their parents and they don't have enough money to go to university. Entry money is so expensive, too, so we cannot help but work a part-time job. I have a part-time job, too. If the entry pay will be low, we don't have to get a part-time job, but now the entry money is expensive. As such, poor students should have a part-time job. Having a part-time job will help to raise independence. While working, I can earn some money for myself. In addition, it will be good to have the experience of working at a store if one wants to open such a store themselves. However, there is demerit of having jobs that is accumulation of stress. Because we cannot earn much money in a short time. Finally, if you have a dream of what you want to do, you can choose the right part-time job so you can gain some experience before your dream comes true. So I agree to have a part-time job while in university. Accordingly, I made my position to agree with this idea.﻿I completely agree with this statement. I have four reasons why I agree with this statement. First, holding a variety of part-time jobs serves to build our experience. For example, if I were to work in a convenience store, I could learn to have a good smile and a good greeting style, or If I were to work in a factory, I could learn patience and understand how appliances are made by the factory. We can receive many diverse experiences by doing part-time jobs. Second, if I hold a variety work part-time jobs, I can find a fitting future job or major. For example, I work at an institute for my money, but fortunately I can find my job by working in an institute that teaches for students. Then I can decide my dream. Also, I can endeavor for my dream and I don't need to wander anymore. Third, I can know the value and concept of money. If I were hardly earning any money, the money I had would be priceless. Therefore, I can't waste the money. I try to save the money and know my parent's difficulty in earning money. Finally, Steve Jobs said \"Connect the dots\", so I take on a variety of part-time jobs that surely someday will help me. In conclusion, I assert that part-time jobs are necessary for college students.﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons why it is important. First of all, they should work in order to maintain their livelihood. There are many students who under financial difficulty. We can't live if we do not eat. If there is no energy, no life can live. The second reason is conversation skills. It is very important because we need social skill to succeed in society. We should talk to other people to get what we need. It will allow us to learn from real life rather than from a teacher. I believe that part-time jobs help to improve this skill. The last reason is to reinforce our university major. I hope that if you want to have a part-time job, you will consider what your major is and what kind of part time job will help you. For example, my major is English literature. To study English and to improve my ability, I will find a part-time job which is related to English. For these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree. I have many friends who have part-time jobs. They often work around their university. In particular, they go to work after finishing their lessons. I do not have any experience of working a part-time job. Nevertheless, I believe that college students need to work, especially during school vacations for the following reasons. First, a part-time job offers students a lesson on the importance of money. They will get money through hard work. Therefore, they will spend less money and save more money. College students usually spend money drinking and enjoying time with friends, so they spend money easily. This lesson can save money from their wastefulness. Second, students receive a lot of money from their parents. Registration fees are very expensive, but many students' fees are paid by their parents. If students get money to cover their own expenses, parents will be appreciative. Accordingly, students need to make the money to use on their own. Finally, students get priceless experiences through a part-time job. After graduating from college, they will work at a company and experience many things at their company. If they have a part-time job, they obtain a new opportunity before their true job. They can learn about their key abilities and personality in advance. It is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree that it is important for college students have a part-time job, even though I have never worked at a part-time job. Nowadays, most college students have to spend a huge amount on registration fees to study at university. The price of registration fees is approaching almost 400-500. However, they don't have any ability to pay these fees, so their parents have to shoulder the entire cost instead of them. If students work at part-time jobs, they would lighten their parents' burden. I think it is also one of the ways to help one's parents. The other reason why I agree with it is that it can help to gain a lot of experience for students' careers. For employment, many companies demand lots of careers of students. It would be good experience to have part-time jobs. Also, students who work part-time jobs can learn how to treat people and to interact socially. In addition, they can develop personality traits like diligence, manners, common sense, and partnership. That's why it is important for college students have a part-time job. Some people worry about that it disturbs students' study, but students with part-time jobs have to manage their time and energy themselves.﻿These days, many college students tend to stay at home without having part-time jobs because of self-improvement. Of course, this behavior gives them a lot of time that they can spend on self-improvement. However, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs. There are some reasons why I agree with this idea. First, college students can keep the spirit of independence. For example, they endure hard work for a month to earn money. These processes encourage them and foster their independence. In addition, the survey of the student council shows that students who experience part-time jobs have independence about four times higher than students who didn't experience part-time jobs. Second, college students are able to pay their school expenses. According to a civic organization's survey, seventy percent of college students pay their registration fees in installments with the money they earn for themselves during vacations. Third, to have a part-time job can make college students very organized and offer useful skills. It is reported that employees who experience part-time jobs quickly adjust to new environments compared with employees who didn't experience part-time jobs. In addition, college students who have part-time jobs can obtain skills that help them find a job. For these reasons, I strongly agree that college students should have part-time jobs: their spirit of independence, school expenses, and adaptability.﻿I totally agree with the idea of Topic A (It is important for college students to have a part-time job.) Let's see some reasons. First of all, it is a good and suitable way to earn money for college students who need to pay their tuition themselves. For example, one of my college friends has a part-time job for her tuition. After finishing school, she goes to her part time job right away. Second, we can gain lots of experience about many jobs before we have our own jobs. For example, when we are college students, some students don't know what kind of jobs they want to have after graduating college, so having a part-time job is a good setting for some students to think about what they want to be after graduating college. Third, having a part time-job is important for college students to have socialization. Of course, they can have socialization when they are in a college, but this is not enough for them. As far as I know, it's very important to meet many kinds of people, so students can meet many kinds of people when they have part-time jobs. That's why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have many bases for my opinion. Most college students don't go to school near their homes; they live near the college. This requires lots of money. Naturally, this life imposes a heavy burden on their parents. We have a lot of time while we are at college. When we leave home, if you have a part-time job, you lessen the burden on your parents, and a part time job offers many experiences. You can work in many kinds of occupation through part-time jobs. You will meet many different people in various workplaces. I think that's the most important thing. A part-time job makes it possible to understand economic activities as you manage spending and income yourself. At first it is hard, but as time goes by you will feel that it's easy. It's practice for your future social life. I think a part time job has many advantages. You don't spend free time on other things when you have a part time job. I recommend working; do not study everyday all the time. It's a greater help than library life to you. It gives many things to you. It's hard to work, but it doesn't disappoint you; I'm confident in it.﻿Recently, there has been a hot debate arising whether taking a part-time job will benefit university students or not. Some people who advocate for having a casual job believe that it helps the students not only financially but also mentally. Other people argue that it is too hard for them to allocate the time to balance between study and work. In this essay, it will discuss both of advantages and disadvantages of having a part-time job. Firstly, there are various advantages to working part-time for university students, who will go into the outside world soon after graduation. The experience of working during their studies will make them better equipped with not only academics from school but also practice from their working experience. It will also give them freedom from financial dependency on their parents. Even though the amount of money they earn is not a lot, it will take some burden off of their parents' shoulders. Secondly, the most important output would be learning social skills by confronting or dealing with people outside of school. Through this kind of experience, university students will learn some skills that they cannot learn from textbooks. Interacting with people outside school will provide them with greater confidence and opportunities to see the real world. People standing against the argument, however, claim that most students will fail to allocate their time properly when balancing between study and work. Moreover, interacting with their peers is very crucial while they are still developing their character. For example, having money on their mind and thinking about everything in terms of monetary value will overshadow some valuable things in life, such as teaching poor children for free or doing volunteer work for underdeveloped countries. In conclusion, in my opinion, the advantages of working part-time outweigh the disadvantages greatly. However, we still cannot ignore the negative effects, so we should try to minimize the disadvantages to the greatest extent without sacrificing the advantages.﻿I think that having a part-time job is very important during university life. First, work is a very precious experience. Part-time jobs in university life are almost always service jobs. So, through working in service, we can meet people of various fields and can talk with strangers. The first time I had a part-time job, I couldn't talk with other people because I had no confidence and was shy. Now I can talk perfectly to strangers. I think these experiences are a benefit of part time work. Next, students can learn the importance of money. Since I was a high school student, I have always lived with pocket money given to me by my parents and I didn't know it was hard to make money. After becoming 20, I have worked hard to earn about 5000-6000won per hour and now I think carefully when I spend money, even just drinking a cup of coffee or eating a spoonful of ice cream. During the five months that I have worked to earn money, I have had various part-time jobs, but I want to have more jobs and meet more people in various fields because I think it is a very valuable experience that I can get during part-time jobs and these experiences are so powerful. Therefore, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job."

    "﻿These days, the interior of all buildings is marked \"non-smoking\". Also, the toilet is non-smoking; you must smoke in the smoking room. Everyone knows that cigarettes have bad effects on the body, and I hate cigarette smoke. Thus, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, cigarettes contain bad things such as naphthalene and many other chemicals. Thus, I am sure that they are harmful things for both smokers and non-smokers. But, cigarette has the worst effect on non-smokers. You should not do damage to other people. Therefore, you should act responsibly. Second, isolate smoking rooms are available in all buildings. Smoking rooms only allow smoking within the room. For example, all coffee shops, restaurants or PC rooms have smoking rooms attached. So, it is right that you should smoke in the smoking room. Finally, cigarettes contain burning material. Lit cigarettes can burn down buildings. Actually, sometimes I have seen news content in which cigarette butts caused forest fires. I think that smoking deserves to be banned at all restaurants and bus stations. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned at buildings or restaurants.﻿I do not agree about smoking on campus. There are more non-smokers than smokers on campus. Because smokers cause damage to nonsmokers' health, and because smoking is bad for smokers' health, they must quit smoking. For Mandy Soled, college and nicotine go hand in hand. A 20-year-old student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Soled never smoked in high school. She doesn't smoke much over the summer, but as soon as a new semester starts, she is back to four or five cigarettes a day. What is it about college life that lures her to smoke? Stress? Peer pressure? Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. Once you start smoking, it is very hard, but not impossible, to quit. Until recently, I think smoking on college campuses was largely ignored. Alcohol is such a major issue in college that smoking takes a back seat. In the last few years, however, smoking has become a hot topic. One of the reasons for this increased importance is the recognition that the college years are crucial in making or breaking an addiction. As a college student, I have seen firsthand the prevalence of smoking. All across our campus, college students are lighting up at an alarming rate. In a campus survey I conducted of 15 college students in February 2002, eight students said they were current smokers. I surveyed eight males and seven females. My survey included 18 questions revealing gender, age, class, familial history of smoking, frequency of smoking, desire to quit, methods used to quit, awareness of hazards, etc. I surveyed several of my classmates in class, a few sorority sisters in our suite, and random students at the HUB.﻿Many people smoke at restaurants today. It is very unpleasant and I hate it. If I see people who are smoking when I am having a meal, I will be very angry. I also agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are two reasons why I hate people who smoke at the restaurant. First, smoking is not good for our health. As you know, many people know this truth and smoking affects other people as well as the smoker. Many non-smokers are suffering from secondhand smoke. Therefore, banning smoking from all restaurants is the only way we can prevent the dangerous effects associated with smoking. Second, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meals at restaurants because of smokers. When I was having my meal at a restaurant, I couldn't eat anymore because of cigarette smoke in the air, so I stopped eating. As always, many non-smokers are suffering because of smokers. In conclusion, smoking is not good for human health, as you know, and we should protect non-smokers by banning smoking from restaurants. It is a very important thing and smokers should also not bother non-smokers. So, smoking must be completely forbidden at all restaurants in the whole country.﻿In front of each building, so many people smoke cigarettes. Some people say that when they smoke cigarettes they feel free and can rest easily between work times. However, I think it's not a suitable way to behave. No matter how they feel, it's a really harmful way to act for everybody, including non-smokers. So, I want to insist that we should prohibit smoking cigarettes for several reasons. First, if someone smoke cigarettes next to others, the bystanders couldn't avoid the potential dangers. We always advise smokers that their children and family could face a potentially harmful situation; their family could have lung cancer, and could get some respiratory disease. For their own family, smokers always think of smoking cigarettes. Second, when someone smokes cigarettes, they can't easily stop smoking because of their addiction. According to several pieces of research, when smokers stop smoking, their hands may shake or they may gain weight suddenly. If they continue to smoke cigarettes, they would be more likely to get mental and physical disease compared to non-smokers. I totally agree that the government should make cigarette prices higher. If it spontaneously makes smokers decrease their intake, the cigarette market will have to get more tax and fix product prices higher.﻿Some people think that ban on smoking at all restaurants is bad. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons why I think so: other people's health, bad smell and clear environment of restaurants. First of all, other people's health is very important. If people smoke at restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the elderly and babies present, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarettes smell very bad and it can make people feel unpleasant. The people have a right to enjoy good smells at a restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at restaurants, the restaurants' environment can become dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarettes can go into the food. Also, the restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarettes. So, because of these three reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Cigarette is made of hazardous materials to be used by people. The composition of a cigarette includes a filter and manufactured tobacco. When they are smoked, many hazardous materials appear in the smoke, but the Filter gets rid of toxic material and it gives smokers  less toxic smoke. The toxic materials in cigarette smoke have lots of kinds, e.g., nicotine, tar, CO, etc. They cause critical damage to the human body. The lungs, in particular, are damaged by smoke. If humans smoke cigarettes, the smoke get into the lungs and causes cancer. But this danger is greater for non-smokers than for smokers, because non-smokers inhale the toxic materials without a filter. For this reason, smoking has a bad effect for non-smokers. Many people who divide into non-smokers or smokers are gathered in restaurants and public places in the country. At the restricted place, non-smokers will inhale toxic material against their wishes. So, the action of smoking in restaurants or public places has bad effects for non-smokers. They are exposed to a greater death rate than smokers for passive smoking. In conclusion, because of this dangerous effect, smoking - which damages our health - should be restricted for the health of non-smokers at restaurants and in public places.﻿I think we should ban smoking in public places completely because cigarettes are harmful to the body. The reason is that the diseases related to the smoking can be prevented and fire hazards can be reduced. Above all, making a rule that restricts smoking in public areas plays an important role in preventing smoking-related diseases. This is because there are all kinds of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The smoke is full of harmful components that can cause cancer, asthma, or other fatal diseases that can affect not only the smokers themselves but also non-smokers around them. Thus, by banning smoking in public places, we can reduce the risk of getting smoke-related diseases. Moreover, preventing smoking in public areas can contribute to decreasing fire danger. Cigarette butts that are thrown away without being fully extinguished can cause irreversible disasters like mountain fires. I have to consider everyone in the world for their families and their health. Also, a strong anti-smoking law should be introduced.﻿I don't support smoking in restaurants. The biggest reason is that it is harmful for our health. It causes a lot of diseases such as lung, throat, and mouth cancers, premature births, sterility and early menopause, and it makes one look older. Scientific studies show that addicted smokers' skin will be grey in color, thick, and wrinkled. In addition, the smokers can also harm the health of the other non-smokers with their cigarette smoke. Although a person likes smoking, other people do not want to breathe their smoke and get second-hand smoke diseases. In restaurants, people are eating something. During a meal, it is easy to breathe in second-hand smoke. In this case, second-hand smoke will be more than normal situation. Therefore, nowadays many countries have tried to make a law that smoking in restaurants is illegal. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we may be saving the lives of hundreds of people, including your own as well as your family's. If a survey was taken asking people how often they deliberately put the lives of their friends and family at risk, it's a pretty safe bet that most people would say never. However, they may be forced to reconsider their answer with regard to smoking.﻿Smoking is very harmful to human beings, but there are thousands of people smoking around the world, even though they know smoking is harmful. The most serious problem is that non-smokers are damaged by the second-hand smoke of smokers. Media has emphasized the danger of second-hand smoking. Lately, the notion of third-hand smoke has appeared. I have seen TV programs about third-hand smoke. A father usually smokes outside and washes his hands with soap. He hugs his baby and plays with him or her after smoking and washing his hands. Even though the baby doesn't smell the smoke, dangerous things are found on the skin of the baby. The research shows that the baby has the same amount of dangerous remnants as adult smokers. I was shocked by the results of this research. After I saw this program, I realized that we can't escape from the danger of smoking anywhere. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public areas where any person can drop by and eat there. In these areas, non-smokers are easily affected by smokers. Smokers have to know the effect of their smoking on others. The government should take action for the health of all citizens.﻿Some people who smoke are very rude. They smoke not only on the street, also in restaurants. When they smoke in restaurants, other people who don't smoke feel upset. Smoking creates fumes and dirty dust. People who smoke smell of cigarettes. That creates discomfort. I think people who smoke in restaurants are selfish. They enjoy smoking and do not care about other people who don't smoke. What I am talking about is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some restaurants have smoking seats, but there are non-smoking seats nearby. Fumes and dust move to every table in the restaurant. Guests in the restaurant might be angry if someone sitting at the next table is smoking. Then, there would be gossip about the restaurant's cleanliness and etiquette. It is a good choice for owners to forbid smoking in their restaurants. Restaurants are where people eat dinner. Maybe it is special dinner for someone. Smoking can break into that special mood. Apparently, smoking in restaurants is a very serious problem. I wish that smoking were banned in restaurants as soon as possible. I want to eat dinner in a restaurant where no one is smoking.",
    "﻿These days, university fees are expensive. So, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, students have grown up depending on the assistance of their parents. You should make your own pocket money and cover your own university fees by having a part-time job. Naturally, it is difficult to concentrate on your university major and it is tiring to sleep less because of your job. Your immune system may become weak, so you may become sick, but not everybody's parents are rich. So, students should have a part-time job. Second, a part-time job is a kind of social life. Therefore, students experience social life and after they graduate from university, it is important to experience social life. Naturally, university life is a kind of social life, but it is different to having a part-time job. Last, by having a part-time job, you can realize the value of money. If one student does not have a part-time job and another student does have a part-time job, their attitude toward money will be different. The student without a part-time job does not realize value of money. The student with a part-time job buy will think about spending their money before buying something. I think I agree that it is important for college students having a part-time job.﻿These days, a lot of students have part-time jobs. On the Internet and newspapers, many companies are looking for students to work for them. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. I also don't think it is necessary, because their parents support them and pay for their expenses. In addition, having jobs has some negative effects. First of all, education is difficult and complex. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. It will have negative effects on studying: they won't concentrate, and they will even be sleepy in class. In the end, it will impact on their grades. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on a fun time of his life. He won't be able to play with his friends and enjoy his own spare time. In other words, if a student spends time on working, he can't enjoy his life. I think that a person's time as a student is the freest time, except for the demands of studying. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help with everything that they want. Therefore, students have to concentrate on studying. In conclusion, students' duty is studying. They have to study rather than work because having part-time jobs has some negative effects as above. One's college days are a favorable time to study.﻿Many college students have a part-time job today. It is very common and many students have part-time jobs. As a student, I also agree that college students should have a part-time job. I will talk about my opinion why I agree that. First, college students will get experiences about social jobs. They can experience hard and good things. It is very important because social experience is very useful to all people. When they are adults, they will have to work and earn money. During their work, they will meet many people and will be faced with hard times, so meeting many people and building experiences are important. Second, they can get their own money. They can buy anything that they want to buy without their parent's help. Further, they can help their parents as they pay their tuition. If they earn money during vacation, they can get much money. Lastly, they can feel a sense of accomplishment as they do their work, so they will work well in the future. In conclusion, as they have a part-time job, they can get social experience and help their parents. They are also able to fulfill themselves through their part-time job. So, it is important for college students to get a part-time job.﻿Most teenagers want to make money without supporting their parents. In my case I could gain lots of advantages when I worked in a part-time job. First of all, I could make different kinds of relationships. As you know, if we enter new circumstances, we can meet many people. Every people makes you learn valuable things, whether you like each person or not. Second, I could gain good skills from a part-time job. If you work in a restaurant kitchen, you could learn to cook well. Also, if you work in an apparel store in a department store, you could give people good service and could match clothes well depending on each situation or purpose. Finally, you can learn how valuable money is and how to deal with money well. If you take money from your parents, you just waste money easily. However, if you earn money for yourself to buy something, you couldn't use your money easily and would think very carefully when you decide to spend it. Through my experiences, if you have an opportunity to work in a part time job, you can gain economical and social advantages in your life.﻿Some people think that teenagers having part-time jobs is bad, because they think part-time work is a cause of their low grades. They even think that the teenagers who have part-time jobs are delinquent students. I think they are prejudiced. Teenagers with part-time jobs can learn about economic strength. Besides, part-time jobs have some other benefits for teenagers. So, in my opinion, having a job when they are still students is a good way for teenagers to learn about society. Here are some reasons that why I agree with the teenagers having their jobs. First, teenagers can know the value of money as they earn money themselves. Most of the teenagers and children get pocket money from their parents, but they don't do anything in order to earn money. They don't know how much their parents worked or where the money comes from. If they have part-time jobs, they can know about these things. So, part-time jobs can help the teenagers to take care of their money. Second, they can learn about many people and personal economics. For example, teens working in some place like 'Starbucks' can see a lot of different kinds of people. Some people are younger than them, but many other people are older than them. They can learn modes of speech, ideas, and attitudes. By doing this, the right values can be established in them. There are many good places where teenagers can work: convenience stores, fast food restaurants, parking garages, etc. Teenagers can learn worthwhile things through their part-time jobs in a way they cannot through textbooks or by doing assignments. Therefore, I agree with teenagers having part-time jobs.﻿I have two opinions of this topic, and this opinion is divided into two viewpoints, that is, an economic point of view and social point of view. First, college tuition is more expensive nowadays than it was in the past. The cost is a burden to many ordinary people -both students and their parents. For this reason, students should work to make money for their college tuition. If students make money for tuition, it will reduce the financial burden for college tuition. Alternatively, students need to make their own pocket money, because college students are adults. Now, they need to embrace their time of economic independence and no longer get money from their parents. Second, to have a part-time job is to gain indirect experience of social life before we join adult society. For this experience, we learned that earning money is very hard, as I have experienced before. We will also experience human relationships of social life. In this society, lots of diverse people are represented in our society. Through this we can learn how to handle these people. Through meeting diverse people, we can learn development of relationships in broader society. To conclude, to have a part-time job gives students many experiences before they join adult society.﻿As important as anything to study at university, I think it's important to have a part-time job during one's college life. So far we do not have much experience, especially of social life. However, through part-time job experiences, we can learn the routines of social life. Through various part-time jobs we may gain a lot of experiences. First is the first career. The second is to find a solution to your problems. Here we will be able to raise our own independence. The third is vocational aptitude, which bridges what you want to be and what you are not fit for yet. Therefore, through part-time job you can learn what you want to be, and you can choose to become that. Part-time rather than irregular work, but more working in a field related to a desired future profession is recommended. The reason being, a part-time job is not just a means of making money; it is a step toward one's future. Recognizing the importance of college credits and a part-time job, and working hard for your college life will be better to live without regrets.﻿Many university students have part-time jobs. There are many different opinions about part-time jobs. Some parents think having part-time jobs can affect the students' study, therefore their children are not allowed to have part-time jobs. Others think that having a part time job is a good social experience. Many students think that they can learn useful skills through various part-time jobs. If you work in a supermarket, you can learn how to promote products. If you are computer savvy, you can make homepages for additional cash. Also, you will learn how difficult it is to earn money, then you will be more willing to study and save money. I believe it is necessary for students to have a part-time job for their future. Most of all, encouraging students to participate in a part-time job may be beneficial for their future success. To be more specific, students will gain experience of what is like to live throughout adult society, which means that they will be prepared for their future as they grow up. Moreover, encouragement for students to participate in a part-time job will be positive for their future. In particular, participating in a part-time job will not only give experiences but they also will gain money, which they can spend on things such as clothing. In addition, they will feel a great sense of accomplishment that they bought things with their own money. So I agree with the statement.﻿A part-time job is an optional thing for college students, but almost all college student must have one. The first reason why they may have a part-time job is that they need lots of money for college tuition and college life. Tuition is very high in my country, so some students take time off from school to earn their tuition. Other students have part-time jobs and go to school at the same time in order to supplement tuition. Also, college students need more money to get together with their friends and enjoy cultural life. They usually earn extra money by doing a part-time job. The second reason is they live by themselves. Some students, especially men, are expected to earn money to live without economical help from their parents. They must achieve financial independence, so they have to have part-time job to live. Therefore, having a part-time job is obligatory for some students in this situation. The third reason is students experience all kinds of things through a part-time job. There are thousands of part-time jobs, ranging from physical work to delicate work. College students can experience various jobs by choosing what kind of work to do. It can help them consider what they want to do in the future.﻿College students need lots of money because they have to pay tuition fees. Also, they need to pay for transportation and they have to buy lunch. All these expenses are a very big deal to students. Registration for school is very expensive. Many students receive money from their parents, but it is limited. Therefore, having a part-time job is required of students. Students can help alleviate their parents' worry by doing a part-time job. Even if students are busy with school work, they can feel satisfied. In my case, my parents give me money once a month. I have no part-time job. I have to spend money reasonably price all of the time. Sometimes, I want to buy brand-new clothes or an expensive bag, but my wallet has a limit so I can't buy things that are written on my wish list. If I had a part-time job, I could buy clothes or a bag. However, having a part-time job makes me tired and very busy so I don't want to have a part-time job. Gathering money is easier for me than earning money. On the other hand, summer vacation and winter vacation are exceptions. In my free time, like on vacation, I will find a part-time job because I'm free!"

    "﻿I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. While it is true that college tuition fees are high these days, scholarships and loans are being offered, too. I believe that this discussion has to take into account the idea of 'opportunity cost'. Take, for example, the case of a student who is deciding whether or not to work to support his studies or to spend more time studying to obtain a better result. The student has the option of working harder and spending more time studying to obtain a scholarship for his studies. The scholarship could solve the student's financial problems in addition to getting excellent results. I believe that this is an issue of investment of time. Students who do part time jobs are generally tired when they attend classes. This could affect their studies indirectly. A person could choose, instead, to invest his or her time on studies while applying for a loan to support their tuition fees. Being able to pay their tuition fees by working part time and being tired or sleepy in classes is not a good option. By doing the comparison, spending more time on studies, thus getting better results, and obtaining a scholarship is a better one. In conclusion, the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job should be discarded as it is not a viable alternative of solving a person's financial constraint problems. It is not wise for a student to forgo his studies to support his or her school tuition fees.﻿I think that college students should have a part-time job before graduating from university, because if they donft have any experience of a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a freshman, I worked for Lotto Riau as a part-time worker for one year. My parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and earn a little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than if I didn't have it. There was a bad aspect. It meant I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought about whether I would stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young, so I had many chances in the future and I had to go to the army. Now I don't regret it. If I was a freshman, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is a well-spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be more successful than someone with no experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.﻿Lots of problems exist in part-time jobs. I would like to discuss low wages, behavior of superiors, and the absence of break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea, and when I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress. When I was at work the manager treated me badly. He swore at me and shouted at me in front of people. At work, break time was not guaranteed. If the manager saw me moving slowly he would tell me to walk faster or to run. Of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid on time. Regarding the behavior of managers or superiors at work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case, as I said, the manager used to swear at part-time staff. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible, because part-time workers are people, too. They do not deserve that kind of treatment. My opinion is that the relationship between part-time workers and superiors should be improved for good. The second problem is that break time is not guaranteed. Humans require food, sleep, etc. to live, but at the part-time job employers want workers to work until their shift is done. That might increase profits, but it is a good way to lose people.﻿A part-time job is a way to look for my future job. We can also experience many jobs through part-time jobs. It is very important to experience other jobs because we don't know that what we are interested in and what we want to be. For these reasons, I think it is a very good way to gain experience. I have had several part-time jobs. They were very hard experiences, but it was a great time for me. When I needed money I sold clothes last year. I worked in a department store. It was very hard and I really wanted quit right away, but I needed money to travel abroad so I couldn't do that. When I was 21, I worked at a theater. It was a very interesting time, but I stressed about money. Because I checked money and calculated money accurately, the theater earned money. I also worked at a buffet restaurant. The work was very hard but eating delicious food was very good. Sometimes people gave me tips, so I thought it was a cool job. A few months ago, I taught middle school students. It was hard work too, because middle school students did not listen to my lessons. I think that the many jobs that I have experienced are going to be good sources in my future. Someday, you can experience many part-time jobs too.﻿I agree with the statement. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to gain experience before getting a job. For example, if students who have finished university get a job and have to work hard, they cannot work effectively because they have not enough experience. In university, no one teaches executive abilities. Second, lots of Korean students do not know the value of money since lots of Korean university students get pocket money from their parents. I think people who have never experienced part-time jobs do not know the value of money. Third, having a part-time job allows students to know about spending money. I think a lot of students do not have experience working in a part-time job and they do not know how to manage spending money because they have never experienced working and earning the money themselves. Because of this, it is a good experience for a university student to work in a part time job. The last thing is that they can get to know lots of people. If students work part-time jobs, they can get to know a lot of workers other than general university students. In Korea, it is important to know the people who are in the same field. Consequentially, I agree with working part-time jobs for university students.﻿Most college students get a part-time job during their school days. Needless to say, lots of students try to get a job in summer or winter vacation, all because they have to make a living for themselves. They say that college registration fees are expensive, and I agree. It's hard to imagine our parents paying all that money. That's why we need part time jobs, Although some do it because they do need money, I say part time jobs are good experience for all of us. But they can be bad if the students try to make part time jobs their ongoing jobs. Some don't go to school at all because of this approach. Anyway, even with all their hard effort trying to earn, the regular wage rules are not being kept. My friend was working in an internet cafe for 3000 won an hour. It's not fair. How can he make a living out of it? The hourly rate should be increased or people should observe the rules. I intend to get a part time job in the summer, but I don't want to work under these circumstances. But I need money, which means that I have no choice. I wish this could all somehow change for all of us.﻿I'm also a current college student and I agree, the students who work even just a small part-time job at school are more motivated to get work done. Now, some students do live off of their own parents' money, which is fine if they are that fortunate. However, if they don't have a need to work, these students should be involved in a club or some type of other activity. There's a lot of responsibility that goes into running an organization on campus and it can help students remained grounded in a similar way that a regular, paying job would. Ultimately, anything that keeps students from becoming lazy is a good thing. Holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. Students will enjoy their work, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on their studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success: time management. If students keep their priorities straight and find a part-time job that is at least tolerable, students will be adding an important element to their future resume.﻿I am going to write as a college student. First of all, yes, I agree with the statement. Doing a part time job is essential for students, and especially college students. It costs a lot to go to the university. Most college students lack both time and money in Korea. Of course it's important to earn money but all of the universities require too much money. Most students can't afford the money by themselves. Me either. I think we should go abroad or experience many things we haven't done instead of studying all day or working every day and staying at home. I insist it is important to do a part time job, but I hate how we have to do a part-time job. Anyway, we can learn many things from doing part time jobs, such as endurance, responsibility and conversation skills. I think these are much more important than the money we earn from doing part-time jobs. We can also learn how to use our time efficiently. To be at work on time, we schedule. That is how we learn to use our time. In addition, typically it's boring to do a part-time job, so I do some exercise or read a newspaper when I am free at work. You don't? But I do!﻿One year ago, I had a part-time job as a cashier. While working as a cashier, I felt several disciplines. At the time, I spent money on clothes, accessories, and rings. I didn't know the value of money, but I worked myself so I regretted my spending. I knew that my parents did hard work. And I felt like studying. While working, I wanted to study. Studying is very easy work. I knew that I disliked physical work. I wanted to work in the field of knowledge. So, I always wrote my income and expenses. When I got some pocket money, I didn't spend it. I saved everything in my savings account, and I really studied hard to gain knowledge. Part-time work is a very valuable experience. If I had not worked my part-time job, I would not have realized the value of money and the value of studying. It improves my mental quality. I think that people must work in part-time jobs at a young age. These days I get high English marks and am a good student. I must not forget my part-time job. My experience is so informative and helpful. I want to work another job so I want to learn another value. My children suggest that part-time work is a very good experience.﻿During your college days, you don't want to waste time but usually many students regret that you squander your time. But I think there are some ways not to waste your time while you study at university. The one of them is to have a part-time job. In fact, many students have part-time jobs, such as waiter, cashier, sales clerk, etc. during their college days to earn money and to gain experience. It is very helpful and very important for students to get a job, even though they don't have to get a part-time job to earn money. I will explain to you that why it is important. First, you can meet various people. Of course, you can meet people at your school but there is a difference between people whom you would meet at your workplace and people whom you would meet at your school. I think talking with various people gives you a lot of ideas. Also, you could have a chance to get information which you want to get. If you do a part-time job that is related to your future work, you can meet some people who have some information you need. It is more advantageous than other people who don't have a part-time job. Second, you earn money having a part-time job, so you can realize how important money is and how to spend money. You could develop a habit of saving money because you don't want to waste the money you earned. Some students waste money, but most students don't waste the money they earned themselves. Thus I think during your college days, doing a part-time job is very helpful, valuable, and worthwhile thing. I recommend you to do a part-time job while you are in university.",
    "﻿I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is because restaurants are places where people eat and most of the time, restaurants are closed areas. Smoking in closed areas would cause passive smokers to inhale as much pollutants as an active smoker. This would cause many health complications to a person. There are so many adverse effects of smoking. The smoke released could also mean that the pollutant particles from the smoke could end up on the food in the restaurant. This is especially unhealthy for the person who consumes the food. It is all the more unhealthy for a person to eat in a confined area, especially in restaurants. Another question which arises is \"why is it that people should smoke while eating?\" Restaurants are meant to be places where people eat. If there should be a place for people who want to smoke, it must be in a special room for people to smoke and not in restaurants. Smoking should never be allowed in restaurants. Restaurants are places for people to eat and not smoke. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is very unsightly for a restaurant to have people smoking in it.﻿I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. A few years ago, smoking was not important to all of us. But now, people's thinking has changed. Comedian Lee Jug-el died of lung cancer. To this day, I can't forget about what he said to the public about smoking. He was as smoker for many years. Before he died, he made an authorized advertisement. In the ad, he appealed to people who had been smoking for many years. He said when you are smoking, you have to stop smoking. If you don't stop, that destroys your family and your life. For example, a man is smoking at the restaurant; we think that he is polite. When he is smoking, he doesn't mind everybody in the restaurant. If he has a thought that he�@should take care of his family or friends, he can't smoke there. Now, people don't allow smoke in the building so we can see people who find the smoking area which is outside of building. Also, if someone smokes at a restaurant, cigarette smoke makes the people annoyed. We want to have the food in fresh air and we don't want to die early because of cigarette smoke. So, if you smoke for years, you have to stop smoking for your future, your family, and your friends.﻿Smoking has always been an issue in our society - inflation of cigarettes, smoking areas, secondhand smoke, etc. All over the world people seem to be quitting smoking. One of the ways this has happened is increasing the cost of cigarettes. In South Korea this issue has been talked about a lot, but does not seem to be working. Recently the cost of Dunhill brand cigarettes has been raised to reduce the rate of smoking, but people who smoked Dunhills changed their brand to a cheaper brand. Secondly, smoking areas are not appointed well, which causes people to smoke in bus stops, inside buildings, and in public areas. In Canada, it is illegal to smoke inside buildings and in public areas. This should be put into action in Korea. And the last issue is secondhand smoking. This issue is related to the smoking area issue. I guess most people know that secondhand smoking is worse than smoking, and secondhand smoking can cause cancer and skin disease. A person I knew from my youth was healthy but she died from lung cancer from secondhand smoking; her husband was a chain smoker. I do not smoke in public areas because I know secondhand smoke is bad and I do not like the way the people see me. Smoking has always been an issue in our society.\n\n﻿\"No smoking\". This is a sign that we can see everywhere. Ironically, we can also see many people smoking freely. Definitely, smoking is the issue in our country and the world. These days many countries ban smoking in official places and in other places. In Korea, we also ban smoking in many places, but I think smokers don't care about this rule. I really don't like the smell of smoking, so if someone smokes in the street my face is going to be frowning. I insist that we should make some rules like smokers have to smoke in restricted areas. It is a very great idea, I think. Many non-smokers are bothered because of smoking. It is very harmful to people's health and to our habitat. Cigarettes contain very toxic material, so people can't quit easily. I think that cigarette companies should increase cigarette prices, and then many people can quit their smoking habit more easily. It is a good idea that advertisers make many ads about not smoking. I hope many smokers can quit their smoking habit so other people can be safe everywhere and all the time. I don't know well how hard it is for smokers to quit smoking because I'm not a smoker. Although it is very hard to quit smoking, you should quit as soon as possible for your health. Maybe you can ask a doctor how to quit your smoking habit if you really want to quit your smoking habit.﻿I agree with the statement. According to the news on the Korean TV, smokers cannot smoke in public areas from 2013. I have four reasons for supporting the statement. First of all, if smokers smoke in restaurants, they influence other customers. Suppose other customers in the restaurant eating some food and smokers are smoking next to their table. The customers really do not like smell and it is disgusting. I think it is not good smoking in public areas. Second, smoking is not good for our health. According to a newspaper I saw, smoking damages smokers' lungs and they cannot live as long as non-smokers. Smoking take a toll on the lungs and prompts cancer of the lungs and lots of other disease. Third, if smokers are smoking in restaurants, other non-smokers are damaged from smokers. I am referring to second-hand smoking. I read some result of the second-hand smoking. It said that non-smokers are damaged if they smell tobacco. I was surprised about that result. The last reason not to allow smoking in restaurants is I think the most important thing in a restaurant is cleanliness. If smokers are smoking in the restaurant, lots of places in the store are dirtier than in a non-smoking restaurant because smoking makes the place dirty. Finally, I think smoking must be banned in restaurants.﻿Smoking is causing a lot of problems presently for students and adults. I bet our country is one of the places where people smoke the most. Honestly, I don't care whether they smoke or not. But students smoking? That's totally wrong. They're destroying their bodies completely before they even fully become an adult. They probably smoke because they think it makes them look cool. Yes, that is true, it does make someone who's smoking look cool. But is looking cool to other people worth more than their own health? Lots of people regret smoking when they get cancer or they make a hole through their neck. Before then, they can never realize how serious this is. Since smoking started to look cool, it's giving a really bad influence to little kids. For example, I saw kindergarten children smoking, not outside, but on the internet. They were spitting saliva out of their mouths. That's not what kids should do. If the government wanted people to make them stop smoking, why didn't they raise the price of the cigarette up to a hundred dollars? Who would dare to buy that? That would really help stop smoking. But then again, cigarettes bring a lot of profit to our land. It cigarettes become illegal to sell, our country will suffer damage in the financial losses. I guess we can't make those people who smoke stop smoking. I just hope it doesn't get worse than this.﻿I think smoking should be banned in public places like restaurants, because it causes more than 1000 deaths from lung cancer. Second hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also setting bad examples for teens and young adults. Also, scientists agree that smoking is dangerous. Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, strokes and heart disease. Smoking does not just harm the smoker; it also harms people nearby who breathe in the smoke. This is called passive smoking. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. People should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. Passive smokers do not choose to breathe in other people's smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public.﻿You are right. I agree with the topic. Smoking is terrible, awful and very bad. Smoking must be banned, not only in restaurants but also in any public places! But I think smoking has been banned at a restaurant already. Hasn't it? Imagine you eat at a restaurant and someone smokes next to you. I wouldn't eat anything if I were you. You lose both money and health if you smoke. Eventually, you pay for disease. What a silly idea! I work out, so I've never smoked and I don't even drink. But my father has smoked for over 20 years. I worry about his health. Smoking can also ruin families. Parents need to stop smoking for their children. Last week I saw something about smoking in a newspaper. The government said that now it's illegal to smoke on a road or a square. I love that. I am done talking about smoking. What else I can say is smoking is worse for other people than it is for the smoker! In addition, smoking makes people stink. Who would want to hang out with a smelly person? Right? Ok I need thirty more words. I hate to tell someone to stop smoking. So smokers need to stop smoking. Let's quit smoking!﻿In my childhood, my father always smoked near me. I thought that smoking was not a bad thing, but in middle school I saw a video that showed that smoking is so bad for people's bodies. I realized that smoking is a very bad thing. I do not smoke, but I am sure that my body is so bad. Because of my father, I experienced secondhand smoking. I don't care about people smoking, but smokers must not smoke near non-smokers. When I wait for a bus at the bus stop, I smell smokers' smoke. It is so bad, smoking near non-smokers. Sometimes, I went to restaurants, cafes and campus. I think that smoking is an unpleasant thing. The government must make non-smoking areas and introduce a smoking penalty system. When I am an adult, I will ban smoking for my children, because it is so bad for a mom with a baby. Smoking is also banned in playgrounds and kindergarten. This gives health benefits. I saw on television that a famous comedian died because of smoking. I was so scared when I saw his death. When I go to a computer fee room, I always feel smoking smell. Smoking should be removed forever.﻿Nobody thinks that smoking is healthy, but there are some people who don't want to quit smoking. They usually smoke everywhere; they even smoke in public places. I think they are addicted. If it makes people feel uncomfortable, smokers should be banned from smoking in public places. As you know, smoking causes so many disease, like lung cancer, tuberculosis, other cancers, etc. Its effects are not limited to smokers, but non-smokers are exposed to second hand smoke, too. Here is reason that why smoking should be banned in public places. First, it causes much disease. If it is banned to smoke in public place, it could reduce the smoking rate. As a result, many people could be healthier. It is very easy for second hand smoke to get a disease from second hand smoking. So I think it should be banned to smoke in public places. Second, if it is banned, it could make for cleaner streets. Usually people who smoke throw away butts on the street. Even though there are so many smoking stands, they don't use them, as if it is very natural act. But I think if it were banned, they couldn't throw away a cigarette. So it would make street clean. Third, if it is banned, it could prevent a big fire. Sometimes the cigarette you threw away could make a big fire. Of course, there are fires of other origins, but I think if you don't smoke in public places it also could reduce the fire rate. Thus I think smoking in public place should be banned by government. If this does not happen, it could make people get diseases, it could make streets unclean and uncomfortable, and it could also make a big fire. So I believe that it should be banned to smoke in public places."

    "﻿When we hear the word smoking, what idea do we have in our mind? All doctors in the world say that smoking is not good for active smokers and it is even worse for passive smokers. Some of us wonder how that can be. The answer is that when the cigarette burns and the active smokers begin to smoke, they breathe clouds of smoke from their noses and mouths. The clouds are inhaled by passive smokers, but the clouds come from the lungs of active smokers and the passive smokers do not know about the active smokers' health. Nowadays, the government has built smoking areas in public places, for example, at department stores, airports, and hotels. The government did so because they hope that the active smokers will not disturb the passive smokers, the health of babies, and the woman who are pregnant. To be honest, the government would be confused if they forbade cigarettes because almost all the employees in this country work at cigarette companies. If they close or stop all the activities of the cigarette companies, they have to think carefully about its effects. The truth is that cigarettes are not good for active smokers and their environment, especially people around them. We hope that the active smokers can reduce or maybe even stop their hobby of smoking. Our health is very expensive, so we have to keep our health.﻿The big problem in Indonesia is smoking because almost all people, especially men, always smoke. And they smoke wherever they want, not only in smoking areas, but they also smoke in public places, in restaurants, in rooms while they are having a meeting, and they do not think about the dangers of smoking in  public places. Because not all people, especially woman, like to smoke, they almost don't like smokers because smoking can disturb other people. You know why I say that smoking is a big problem in Indonesia? Because almost all of Indonesia's income is from smoking. Therefore, if the cigarette companies close down, there are many people who will lose their job and won't be able to pay for their lives. However, I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Why do I agree with that opinion? Because first, if we smoke, we have to spend our money buying cigarettes every day. Second, if we smoke in the restaurants, we will disturb other people who are eating there. Because the vapor of smoke can make our breath smell, especially for woman. While people will not forbid those who want to smoke, they also know which places to smoke. So, if we are in a restaurant, we should not smoke because we can disturb others, and we must know if we smoke, we can cause cancer.﻿I think the topic is interesting enough to give a detailed explanation. In Indonesia, many people have different opinions about completely banning smoking at the restaurants. I will explain why smoking should be banned in restaurants. Firstly, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because the restaurants have AC, so this annoys people who come into the restaurants with their family such as children or an elderly father. Secondly, smoking in the restaurants makes the restaurants smell. Commonly in the restaurants, there is a different place for the smoking and no smoking areas so that nonsmokers will be comfortable in the restaurants. Thirdly, smoking in the restaurants is not good for our health. If customers are eating in the restaurants and they become unhealthy, of course this is a serious problem and needs to be quickly solved. If a young people man gets lung disease, the smell of a cigarette can worsen his disease, and the young man could die. This is a very serious problem. For the reasons explained above, I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is not good for people's health.﻿I agree, because I am not a smoker, and I am a girl. Smoking is a waste of time, I think. May I take you on a little journey into my mind about smoking. Let's imagine that we are smokers! We buy cigarettes every day to burn into ash, but actually what we burn is our money; that is terrible that we buy something that can hurt ourselves with, especially our health. In other cases, cigarettes are poison. Everybody knows that, but they cannot leave the cigarette because the poison is in the cigarette itself. If someone smokes it once, he will try again, and again, and again. He was poisoned with the cigarette, and in the period, the cigarette was the primary tool. If we ask ten men, eight from them will say “I am a smoker.” This is the proof that cigarettes are poisoning almost all men in the world. If we don't smoke, we are passive smokers, we must warn smokers to change their smoking habits. If they can't stop smoking, we should tell them to be understanding of us as passive smokers so that they only smoke in private areas not in public areas, such as restaurants.﻿Smoking is the personal right of each person, and each person also has the right not to breathe smoke or even face the dangerous consequences of smoking. Smoking should not be allowed in public places so that people who do not smoke do not feel uncomfortable; however, smoking is not good for your health so it should be prohibited. Many people still smoke in public places, especially in restaurants, where people need comfort and nutrition for the body. When there are people smoking, the comfort is reduced and people could risk many potential illnesses. It is not possible for restaurants to make rules that ban smoking because they do not want to lose their potential customers, so it would be nice if every restaurant had a special place for smokers who are already addicted to smoking so that customers who do not smoke will not feel uncomfortable in restaurants and customers who are comfortable with billowing smoke have special rooms. It would be better if no-one smoked because we cannot get any advantage from smoking, only losses. So, it is not easy to decide to ban smoking in a restaurant.﻿I agree with this statement because smoking is a bad habit. As we know, smoking is an activity that gives no benefits and wastes our money. Smoking also makes people sick and causes serious diseases, not only for the smokers, but also the people who breathe in the smoke of their cigarettes. Smoking in the restaurant is also not polite because a restaurant is a place for eating. It will harm others. In the world, every year we can find 2.2 million human deaths because of lung disease. The disease is coming from many years of smoking. Cigarettes contain nicotine. If you think that nicotine is the only dangerous chemical in cigarettes, you are wrong! Nicotine can be absorbed into the blood. It makes a smoker feel relaxed because it is a neurotransmitter. It also makes a heartbeat, blood pressure, and adrenaline feel better. This makes a smoker want to smoke again. Cigarettes are made of tobacco, which is dangerous because it causes lung disease, heart disease, emphysema, and the other diseases. Some other dangerous materials in cigarettes include cyanide, benzene, cadmium, ammonia, and naphthalene. In all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned because it disturbs other people.﻿Smoking is a bad habit which is always done by stupid people, who think they look cool if they are smoking, or they believe that smoking can reduce their stress. But they forget about the risks to their health, and they do not care about the people around them. People who do not smoke (passive smoker) but spend their life in a smoking area will be in danger because they breathe in the bad air or the pollution from the smoker, and it will be cause problems for their lungs. Restaurants are places where people eat or gather, so there are people and food. So, I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because the air will be bad and full of pollution from the cigarettes. And the passive smoker will get harmed. And the food will also become toxic because it is infected by the air. So, if we eat the food, it will make our body sick because the quality of the food is not good anymore. Also, the smoker will make people around them become passive smokers, and they will make their family sick. Smokers do not understand that when they are smoking, it is the same as if they are burning their money, and smoking will decrease their time in the world. One cigarette equates to one hour. So can you imagine? Nothing benefits our body from smoking; it is full of toxins that can destroy our body. I think it is better to avoid cigarettes and save our health, our children, and our families. Live happily without decreasing your time in this world because of cigarettes.﻿Companies in Indonesia sometimes have no smoking areas, because in Indonesia there is not yet an international standard. Industries which have an international standard usually have an area for smoking; smoking in Indonesia was forbidden a long time ago, but this is ignored because almost people in Indonesia are hard smokers, so it is not easy to stop people smoking. Almost all young people smoke every day, in fact every hour. Almost all of them use the cigarette as a friend when they are quiet, in restaurants, sometimes in public facilities, at bus stops, and at the market, etc. In restaurants, almost all people smoke when they are waiting for someone. All of the country should be banned from smoking, but most people ignore it, even though they know the effects of smoking. Restaurants in Indonesia have no area for smokers, so people smoke everywhere. There are many cases of death from the serious effects of smoking, but many people ignore it. Safety signs in restaurants forbidding people to smoke are ignored by some people and they still smoke without obeying the rule. Activities in the restaurant, which are followed by smoking, make people consider it a place for smoking. So, smoking should be banned in every city and country.﻿We know that smoking should be banned in all places actually. Why? Because it has many risks for all of aspects of our life, even in the restaurants in this country. And I think it is done properly. I agree with this statement to ban smoking in restaurants. Restaurants are public facilities where there are so many people who are not smokers. Many people take their children because restaurants are places for people to get together. So directly or indirectly, smoking can influence the comfort of visitors. We know there are so many bad effects of smoking. First, the biggest effect is disturbing the breathing and the lungs, and causing lung cancer. This is one reason why smoking is not allowed in restaurants. But I think, this rule is not only for restaurants, but also other public facilities, such as the market, mosque, church, bus stop, and railway station. One solution is that the owners of restaurants provide a special place for smokers. But sometimes, this rule is not followed by some people, they are lazy about going to the smoking area. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoking, they should give a hard punishment for everyone who disobeys the rule.﻿I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. It does not have any positive effects for the restaurant. It only can disturb the customers in the restaurant. Many customers will be passive smokers. Not only that, the smoke from the cigarettes will also poison the food and make people unhealthy. Passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking. Passive smokers indirectly smell the smoke from the cigarette of the active smoker. The smoke is the poison, so the passive smoker is breathing in the poison from the cigarette of the active smoker. In many restaurants, there will be many children. If the restaurant is free of smokers, the children will smell the smoke from the cigarette. The food that has been served will automatically be poisoned because of the cigarette smoke, so the food will not be healthy. There is a solution if restaurant owners do not want to ban smoking from the restaurant, they must have a smoking area. A smoking area is a place for smoking. It is a closed room away from the main room, so the smoker can smoke freely in that room.",
    "﻿Nowadays, there are so many university students who not only go to their campus, listen to their teacher's explanation, do their tasks, and study, but also take a part-time job. University students do this to fill their spare time after they have finished studying at their university. By taking a part-time job, they hope they can get a salary to fulfill their university needs, such as paying for copies of papers, going to the Internet center to search for content for their homework, buying some books to support their reports, and joining a study tour, which is a program from their university to make a thesis. Besides getting a good enough salary from their part time job, they want to have experiences, challenges, friends, network, and enjoy their young life before they really start life in the working world. University students who take a part-time job would be wise to set their time between their duty as a university student and their part-time job. Actually, it is not easy, but when they decide to take a part-time job, they already thought hard about the positive sides and the negative sides. They also should have permission from their parents to get a part-time job. My friend works as private teacher in her spare time, and she is good at time management and enjoys her work. Because of that, she has become an independent woman, which means that a part-time job can sometimes have a good effect.﻿Studying is more important than other things for all people in the world because with study especially in school, we can get a lot of knowledge, friends, and experiences. For example, in Indonesia, compulsory study is nine years. But in reality, poor people cannot continue their studies because they don't have enough money. That is one factor that requires students to have a part-time job, especially university students. They must have a part-time job. Why do I say it like that? First, because not all students at university have parents who can afford to pay for them. Second, if we have a part-time job, we can learn how to manage our time. Third, if we have a part-time job, we can help our parents pay for our studies at university. We can live by ourselves, and we do not always have to live with other people, especially our parents. The conclusion for the importance of college students to have a part-time job is that, if we have a part-time job, we can help our parents pay for our studies at university, we can manage our time, and we can study without living with our parents forever.﻿A part-time job for college students? If you talk about a part-time job, we will find agreements and disagreements. How about you? Is this important to you? Firstly, everybody has different opinions. I think a part-time job for college students is very important at this moment because the students could make money to buy all the tools they need to live by themselves. College students could buy their books, food, drinks, and enjoy their time with special friends. Secondly, I feel that a part-time job would help their parents. If the students' families do not have enough money for the college student (child), who will be completing the need for the college students? Of course, the college students themselves. College students should value the great struggle of living by themselves. Thirdly, in my opinion, a part-time job is good for college students because they have a lot of free time, so college students should use their time to make sure everything happens ok. Fourthly, I feel a part-time job gives experience to college students because the experience is the best teacher of additional knowledge for college students. For the reasons above, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Actually, we must realize that a part-time job is good for college students.﻿As we know, college students are doing their task in college to study; almost all of them come from outside the city. Perhaps they are not from a rich family but from a poor family. Some of their parents have professions such as a farmer, teacher, or fisherman. In fact, it is not their obligation to look for money, but this is a kind of demand for their life. They need money for their life. So, there is a reason why some people need to have a part-time job and others do not. Sometimes, we find that college students have a part-time job to complete their necessities such as living costs and college administration. And we also found some college students do it to search for an experience for their future and have a better life, and some only want to fill in their free time or have fun. So, in my opinion, having a part-time job is important for college students. Besides helping their parents, they can learn how to manage their time and their finances in their life from now on.﻿Part-time jobs have both positive and negative sides for college students. Part-time jobs can give experience to students, but they can also increase students' laziness to gain knowledge in lectures and prevent students from completing tasks well. Working part-time fosters a lazy mind, a desire to pursue money, and develops envy, spite, selfishness, and arrogance. Thoughts of chasing money are actually very good for the students future work when they need to demonstrate perseverance at work. I think the better part-time work is that directly supervised by the college, where the work is equated with the task of lectures. With that formula, students can feel how hard the atmosphere in employment is and foster independence while also becoming more cautious in their work. The students can also consult directly with the supervisor or lecturer of the course if there is a problem in the job. Part-time jobs that have been set by the college are not expected to disrupt the student's learning and will fostering positive thoughts. In general, I support the idea of part-time work for college students on the condition that the job will not lead to failure in their studies.﻿A college student is transitioning to adulthood. A college student is different to junior high school or senior high school students. At junior or senior high school, we didn't think about our future. At college, we have opened our minds to plan for the future. We can do so with a part-time job. A part-time job is very important for college students. I feel that college students who do part-time jobs can become more confident, independent, and responsible. College students who interact and deal with adults learn, through experience, how to behave appropriately in public. Moreover, working for a small sum of money teaches college students the value of hard-earned money. Children who solely depend on their parents for their financial needs quite naturally take the money that they are given for granted. They may also tend to spend their money on useless things. In addition to getting the extra money, they can prepare their future career. College students also do part-time jobs to get some experience for future jobs. This experience will be very useful when they come to working in the real world, because they can get some experience that will relate to their next job. Finally, the transition between the studying and the working worlds is great. Many find it difficult initially to adjust to the working world after schooling. College students who have worked part-time will be more comfortable with the transition.﻿Getting a job is difficult in our country. Many people try to get a job because a job is the way we can realize our dream and fulfill our needs as people. They will be happy doing that because they can increase their perspective on life. There are many benefits of having a part-time for college students. We can get experience, get training for time management, and become more mature. Getting experience is important, because experience is good for us. With much experience in our life, we can easily face problems in our life. For example, if we often perform in front of many people with different cultures, we can reduce our nerves and get more knowledge. Getting training for time management is also important; with having a part-time job, we can think a lot, and it will be make us more disciplined. We must think about when we must study as a college student, and we must keep good time as a worker. So, we must balance between being a student and worker. It will not become a problem if they work together. Before choosing a job, we must combine our schedule first to avoid decreasing our achievement. Having a job is mature, because we can increase our confidence and use our brain before doing something. And we always have to think about our responsibility in every aspect because in the workplace, we are required to do that to avoid making mistakes. Having a part-time job is important for college students because we can learn good time management and we can become successful people. Additionally, if we are diligent, we can even become a young millionaire, and we will become good people.﻿The costs students incur on campus are not small; every month can cost up to a million for meals, transportation, books, and cigarettes for smokers. The income of a parent who is an entrepreneur can sometimes cover this amount, but other parents need more than one income. Every student wants to cover the cost when they live far away from their parents. Some students who have many necessary payments on campus need to look for money by themselves, so they usually work at a cafe, do car washing, work as a newspaper agent, or work at an Internet rental shop. But sometimes, they have problems dividing their time, and they sometimes ignore their assignments from college. But, they feel proud they can complete part of their costs of college without asking their parents. If all students do this, surely all parents would feel proud but they must not complete all of the necessary things. Thus, if sometimes the parents' income is not enough to pay the campus costs, we have to get money by ourselves to cover everything from books to the boarding house without asking our parents. In my opinion, a part-time job helps students support their financial problems and I agree that students should work part time.﻿While academic studies are the main focus of college students, many will also spend their college years in part-time employment. Some reasons they do is that part-time work gives us financial advantages and introduces us to real work. First, part-time work gives students financial advantages. With the salary, you can learn to be independent, you can save your money, and you can help your parents, and it indirectly makes your parents proud of you. Second, with part-time work, the students learn about real jobs. It advances your skills. Many on-campus part-time jobs will give students the opportunity to learn administrative skills, such as phone and email etiquette, office electronics troubleshooting, and meeting manners. Gaining such skills while in school will place a student-employee ahead of the curve when they enter the full-time workforce. And then, experiencing workplace culture classroom learning is important, but the culture of workplaces and offices are hard to impart within the classroom. Holding down a regular position outside the classroom will allow students to gain firsthand experience of office culture and politics, which will be helpful upon graduation and in their first full-time job. The last reason is that part-time work requires you to balance your time. If you have leisure time you can get a job after you have studied. However, if you can't manage your time, you should not get a part-time job because it can decrease your academic scores.﻿At this time, many college students already have a part-time job. Part-time jobs are different from ordinary jobs. Part-time jobs have reduced work time, almost half of the normal work time. And the salary it is not as much as the salary of a full-time worker. The salary of a part-time worker ranges from Rp 100,000 (one hundred thousand rupiahs) to Rp 1,000,000 (one million rupiahs). It can exceed one million rupiahs depending on what kind of part-time job you have. I say it is important, because college students can get more experience before they enter the real world of business. College students can feel how hard it is to make money, so they become more mature naturally. Part-time work can increase students' skills if the part-time job they take is in the same field as their major. They can also improve their skills for managing time. If they take a part-time job, the students should arrange their part-time schedule with their college schedule. So, it will develop the college student's discipline. That's why is think a part-time job is important."

    "﻿Everyone must know that smoking is very dangerous. It has had many bad effects on smokers and people around them. Smoking can give both active and passive smokers many diseases. It can cause cancer and many other health problems. Smoking inside a room is very dangerous for passive smokers. Usually, passive smokers have to cover their noses or leave the room as fast as possible. But, in some places like a restaurant, we can't get out when there are people smoking near us. We usually eat in a restaurant for a long time. If people near us are smoking, it spreads the smoke to many people. Smoke that is produced from cigarettes is very dangerous for our health. If we inhale it over a long period, we could get serious health problems. People should think about others. They shouldn't smoke in front of others because it could give both active smokers and passive smokers many diseases. It can cause cancer and many other health problems. If they can't stop smoking in front others, I think restaurants should ban smoking for the sake of all people. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country so that people who eat in the restaurants can eat calmly.﻿I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, smoking is not good for our health. First of all, cigarettes contain nicotine that can damage our lungs and make it hard for us to breathe. The government also gives warnings to smokers to reduce the number of smokers. We can see the warnings on every pack of cigarettes, and it is said that smoking can cause cancer, hypertension, and also disturb fetuses. Smoking affects not only us, but also other people. Smoke destroys the fresh air and sometimes causes people to cough when they breathe it in. If smoking is not banned, it can annoy other people that do not smoke, who are called passive smokers. The smoke of cigarettes is more dangerous for passive smokers than for active smokers, because the smoke that is aspirated by the active smoker is not good for our health. We must maintain our health because we are the next generation of our nation. Besides, we must make the environment better and keep the air fresh and free from smoke. Those are some reasons why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿In my opinion, being a smoker harms our body, and I absolutely hate smokers around me. My father is a smoker so I stay away from him when he smokes. I'm pretty confused by the people who smoke in places such as terminals, malls, and buses. In my mind, I always wonder whether they realize there are people among them? Definitely, they don't think about that and they don't have any respect for them. I have a lot of reasons why we should not smoke. First, smoking affects our health, and we must spend a lot of money buying cigarettes, and we know that being a smoker damages our lungs. And you can get some diseases such as cancer that reduce the length and quality of your life. And the other reason is out of respect for the people around you, because smoking is pretty disturbing to others. When you smoke, you not only harm yourself but you also harm all the people around you, so you must be selfish. If you love yourself, please stop smoking!! Think about the people around you, who love you, like your friends and your family. I'm sure they won't want to see you suffering or sick because of it. You just spend your life, your money, and most importantly, you will spend much money on medicine when you get sick. So, you should think hard about stopping smoking because we have dreams for our life. I really disagree about smokers, who don't have any respect for themselves and other people.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking has a lot of bad effects. Smoking is bad and extremely dangerous for our health. People usually go to restaurants for food not for smoking; they want healthy food not bad food. Smoking should perhaps be banned not only in restaurants but also in public places. Many people feel disturbed when they are eating by smell of the smoke because they can't smell the food. Smoking should be completely banned because there is no benefit from smoking, it is only bad for our health; there is no gain from smoking, only pain. Secondhand (passive smoker) smoke is more dangerous than filtered smoke so it is detrimental to people around smokers. Many people have suffered because of cigarette smoke; there are people with severely damaged lungs and hearts because of smoking and passive smoking. Small children are vulnerable to cigarette smoke, which is bad for their growth, health, lungs, and heart. Smoking causes a lot of harm to people, especially when they are eating, because an article I read said that when we are eating, we also inhale the smoke.﻿In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because a restaurant is a general place for people to eat their meals. It is also a favorite place for everyone to hang out with their family or friends, so many people spend their time at restaurants. If there is someone that smokes, it will disturb the enjoyment of other people. The smoke of the cigarettes will pollute the environment and endanger the not only the smokers but also the people who do not smoke. Some people, especially ladies, cannot stand the smoke of cigarettes and the smoke will certainly harm them. They may not enjoy their meal or they may even have difficulty breathing. Also, cigarettes are bad for our health, especially secondhand smoke. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette or cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in the close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as coughs, bronchitis, asthma, and carcinoma of the lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. So, to keep our body healthy, not only should restaurants should ban smoking, but also other general places.﻿Smokers are really annoying because of the smoke. The smoke not only damages themselves, but it can also damage all the people that are near them. Because of that, there are two kinds of smokers, active smokers and passive smokers. Active smokers usually smoke wherever they want, even if there is not a smoking area. The most often place that they smoke and the most annoying too is at a restaurant. When we are eating we will be disturbed by their smoke everywhere, so smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country, not only because of their smoke that flies everywhere, but also because, even if there is a smoking area, it is still annoying because sometimes restaurants put the smoking and no smoking places too near to each other. So sometimes we still can see the smoke, and even if we don't see the smoke, it still can be dangerous because travels in the air and can get into other people's bodies and damage their lungs or other organs. So because of that, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, to ensure other people's comfort and to decrease the total number of smokers in this world.﻿In Indonesia, smoking is not forbidden for most people and in most places. People can smoke wherever they want in public. But certain places, such as malls, restaurants, hospitals, and schools forbid people to smoke. In my opinion, smoking in public places should be prohibited because of the disturbance it causes to others. Research says that passive smokers are 80% more likely to suffer from cancer than active smokers. After knowing that fact, people start to think about how to overcome this kind of problem. For example, shopping centers usually provide smoking areas for smokers. Hospitals strictly forbid smoking inside the hospital because it can create an unsuitable environment and cause more bacteria and viruses. Next, I will talk about smoking in restaurants. I will divide the restaurants into three levels: small-scale, mid-scale, and large-scale restaurants. Small-scale restaurants usually allow customers to smoke inside the restaurant. They don't separate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Mid-scale restaurants such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds sometimes provide a smoking area for customers. For example, they provide outdoor seats for customers who smoke. In this scale, usually after the customers enter the restaurant, they will be asked whether they smoke or not and they will be directed to the smoking area if they smoke. Large-scale restaurants usually already forbid people from smoking. They don't have smoking areas to prevent disturbance to other customers.﻿This is very important for us to follow, because it is not just that smoking is dangerous for the smoker, which could cause a lot of diseases such as cancer and heart attacks, but it could also harm people near to the smoker; these people are called passive smokers, and these poor people will suffer more than the smoker because they inhale the smoke directly from the cigarette. Not to mention that a cigarette contains some substances that are addictive. Maybe it is as addictive as a drug because it makes people want more. Some restaurants in this country still allow customers to smoke. I think that is not a good way to develop a restaurant because their smoke can be very annoying, and it could also change the taste of food from that restaurant. It is true that some restaurants provide a special room for those who smoke, but that alone won't really help to ban people from smoking. That will only give them a special privilege, or something like a special room for them. A way to stop them is to not give smokers an option at all, a no smoking area. If only every restaurant wanted to applied this, but sadly they don't, and that is why smokers still exist in restaurants.﻿As we know, smoking is bad for our health. But, there are still many people who smoke. Once they begin smoking, they can rarely can stop because they become addicted to it. When we are addicted to something, it's hard to get over it. People who don't smoke can also get the effects of the smoke as passive smokers. Passive smokers inhale cigarette smoke even though they don't smoke. One effect of being a passive smoker is lung cancer. So, to protect other non-smoking people, the government sets a rule that prohibits smokers from smoking in public spaces, such as at malls and universities. According to the rule, malls and other public spaces have to provide some places where the smoker can smoke. At restaurants, there are places that are assigned as smoking areas. Although the area is separated, the smoke can still affect people who don't smoke. This is because there is no glass separating the smoking area from the no smoking area, so we can still inhale the smoke. Let's look at an example, when the restaurant is full and the waitress places someone who smokes near our table, it will annoy us because of the smoke. So, I think it's better for restaurants to not allow smoking in restaurants.﻿I agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, smoking is not good for our health. First of all, cigarettes contain nicotine that can damage our lungs and make it hard for us to breathe. The government also gives warnings to smokers to reduce the number of smokers. We can see the warnings on every pack of cigarettes, and it is said that smoking can cause cancer, hypertension, and also disturb fetuses. Smoking affects not only us, but also other people. Smoke destroys the fresh air and sometimes causes people to cough when they breathe it in. If smoking is not banned, it can annoy other people that do not smoke, who are called passive smokers. The smoke of cigarettes is more dangerous for passive smokers than for active smokers, because the smoke that is aspirated by the active smoker is not good for our health. We must maintain our health because we are the next generation of our nation. Besides, we must make the environment better and keep the air fresh and free from smoke. Those are some reasons why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",
    "﻿In high school, most students don't do a part-time job. I think that's because some of the students who were doing a part-time job still couldn't manage their time effectively. In fact, their scores were decreasing because of it. We are students whose first priority is studying. If a part-time job has a bad effect on our scores, I think it is better to stop doing the part-time job. But now we are college students, we have to manage our time wisely, and we should consider that doing a part-time job can give us many advantages. With a part-time job, we can help our parents earn money. And, instead of collecting money, we can get wonderful experiences from doing a part-time job. Experiences can help us do many things and make a conclusion. Experience is required when searching for a real job. Nowadays, there are many college students that do part-time jobs while studying at college and they do well in college and in their part-time job. If we could do them both, we shouldn't hesitate to do both college and a part-time job. It really gives us the precious experience that we need. It is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿Nowadays, college students are allowed to have part-time jobs while studying. The types of jobs vary from shop clerks to cleaning services. I think that these part-time jobs are important for college students. As we know, not everyone in this world is rich. The same applies to college students. Some of them cannot afford their education fees and might need to have an additional source of income. One of those sources is doing a part-time job. Part-time jobs allow college students to earn money without neglecting their studies. It is an effective solution for students with monetary problems. Besides money, part-time jobs also give students work experience. When we enter the working world, experiences are a good asset for us. Those assets can be gained by doing part-time jobs. For example, in some restaurants, we can see many part-time workers working as waiters. Those waiters can get communication experiences while serving the customers. Part-time jobs can also improve some essential skills such as time management. Part-time workers must manage their time so their work schedules do not clash with their college schedule. Also, they must know when to take a break for learning and doing projects. This way they can learn how to manage their time effectively. Part-time jobs can be helpful for college students. They can provide an additional income and experiences and build our skills. So, I think it is important to have a part-time job.﻿I think getting a part-time job while studying depends on the person. If he or she wants to earn money or get more experience, I think it should be okay. But, when we are really busy, have no time, and get easily tired, it is not the better choice. Getting a part-time job has a negative and positive sides. On the positive side, you can get more money for helping your parents, increase your income, get more experience, get more friends, be more independent, and take care yourself, so you can be more mature. On the negative side, you can get easily tired, spend a lot of time working, and have less time to study. If you want to get a good mark, I think you should think twice about taking a part-time job. Even if we can manage our time and maintain all of this, we should think twice about the effect on our body's health, because taking a part-time job is pretty difficult when you can't manage it well. If I must choose, I will not get a part-time job because it is difficult from me to manage my time, and actually I am easily tired. Despite not having any goals in my major (accounting) except getting a good final exam mark, I just do all of this as usual. Taking a part-time job like this just takes my time and puts myself at risk, so I absolutely refuse to do a part-time job.﻿I feel it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Whether it is important or not depends on their economic situation, ambitions, and other reasons. If their parents are rich, maybe it is not too important because they can pay for all of the college fees and books. But if they are a poor or middle-class family, maybe sometimes they need to do a part-time job to add to their income, or maybe they want something more. Some college students sometimes have a part-time job to fulfill their ambitions to be richer, but I think studying is more important for college students than doing a part-time job because the smarter they are, the faster they will finish their course, and they will save more money because they do not need to repeat their course. They will also be ready to face a better job and be more focused than before because they do not need to split their concentration between their part-time job and study time. For poor students, of course, a part-time job is important because they need more money to pay for the college fees, for their books, and their transportation. Generally, some students do not take a part-time job seriously.﻿There are three reasons why I agree that college students should have a part-time job. First of all, they will learn how to manage their money effectively. When working part time, they will get more money and they can reduce their parent's burden by helping to pay their school fees. It is not only money that the student must be able to manage effectively. The student will learn how to manage their time too. They will learn how to divide their time between work and study. This way, they will become an expert in time management if they can balance their part-time work with their studies. Also, their time won't be wasted doing activities that aren't important or are unproductive. And finally, the students will get more friends outside of the university. It can be hard to meet people when at university or at least in a different crowd of people. But if you work outside the university, you will meet lots of new people; making new friends can be refreshing when university becomes a bit stale and suffocating. Some people may disagree with me, but I believe there are more benefits than drawbacks for people who work part-time while studying.﻿As a college student, it is important to have a part-time job because it has many benefits for them. The first benefit is that it can increase their work experience before they have a real job. Students need to know how to act in the workplace, what they must do, and how to use their abilities at work. And they need to know too how to talk with the boss, what they need to do to earn a raise, and learn socialism at their workplace. The second benefit is to help their parents with their school funds. Having a part-time job can help students decrease their parents works, or increase their monthly income. It is useful for poor families that have a low monthly income. The third benefit is that it can help a student prepare for when they have a real job, so they will not be surprised when they feel something different from working; the level of difficulties between real life in the workplace and college life is really different. At college, we only get frustrated from the homework or things related to studying, but at work we can get frustrated by our boss, our rivals, or even our friends.﻿Part-time jobs for college students depends on the person's point of view. In some countries, part-time jobs are considered a form of learning to merge with society, learn about the working environment, and gain new experiences. Indonesian people have many different opinions about part-time jobs. Some think that part-time jobs are not necessary and students should focus on their college work. They think that the experience of working can be learned later after their education is finished. Some parents think that working can disturb the learning process of their children, while others think that working can make their children unwillingly continue their study as they will prefer working to learning. I have two different points of view. Firstly, I agree that working can be used as the media of learning for society. Students will be able to see and understand many new conditions, levels of work, and increase their funds. By receiving a salary from working, students can help their parents indirectly because they can use their salary for their daily needs. But working is not recommended for students who are already too busy with assignments and activities. Some colleges force students to study by giving them a lot of tasks. Some students get into the organization of extracurricular activities such as sports. If they are already busy with their work, it will become a burden for the students to work at a part-time job. I conclude that part-time work can be effective for certain people.﻿It is important for college students to have a time part-time job because college life requires a lot of money. So, as a way to help their parents, college students should spend some of their time working at a part-time job. And talking about a part-time job, there is a great variety of jobs, ranging from looking after a shop to helping at a local farm. While it has its own difficulties, looking after a shop might be an easy option, but taking care of a farm's animals or crops will require a lot of energy, some extra skills, and knowledge. The variety of payment that a college student can have is also different. Some jobs will not give you much but other jobs will be rewarding. The problem with having a part-time job is that, if you cannot manage your time, you will not have time to study or do some homework and this will have a bad effect on your study results. So, time management when you have a part-time job is very important. Here are some tips: try to find a part-time job that will not require your entire week since studying and rest are very necessary, and find a job that you can really do well. I think that would be all.﻿Since we were born until we graduated from high school, our parents have supported our financial needs. Even while attending college, we still use our parents' money. But not all students rely on their parents. Some work part-time teaching elementary, junior high, or senior high school students. Working part-time does not mean you have to be a teacher; there are many other jobs. We can look for them on the Internet or ask for help at the CAC (Career Assistance Center at our university). Or, we can ask for recommendations from friend who already have a part-time job. Working part time doesn't mean we have to work while we are studying. We can work part time during the holidays, so we don't waste our time lazing around not knowing what to do. By working part time, we can get some activity to do, and we can get money to lessen the burden on our parents. Working part time also gives us experience. However, later, when we are looking for a job to fulfill our needs, we can write our part-time job on our CV. So, it's important for us as college students to have a part-time job. Although, we can't fulfill all of our needs, we can learn to be independent.﻿Part-time jobs should be applied to students of XXX University. First, part-time jobs can be useful for students to gain additional experience. Besides getting experience at their university, they can also get experience outside of the university by taking a part-time job. The worlds of work and study are totally different. Part-time jobs give students a lot of benefits, for example, they become aware that when they graduate they will work like they work at a part-time job. Hence, they will be accustomed to working and will not get shocked about how hard the world of work is. Also, they will find out how hard it is to make and collect money by working at a part-time job. Second, by taking a part-time job, students can learn to manage their time well. Taking a part-time job means that students are ready to balance their energy, time, and mind. A part-time job takes up a lot of time. So, students should be able to manage their time well, so it does not interfere with the time needed for studying, or doing homework or assignments. Last, a part-time job is very useful for students who have a lot of leisure time because they can apply their leisure time for useful things. They can do a part-time job when they have finished studying. Part-time jobs can be done by each student provided they have enough time to work."

    "﻿Smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country because cigarettes has a strange chemical composition that can cause cancer, heart attacks, hypertension, problems in pregnancy, and even impotence for the users. Smoking can disturb others, because the smoke contains chemicals contaminate the air, are dangerous to others, and are the cause of many diseases. The first issue of smoking is that it can disturb others because of the composition of the smoke, it is the same dangerous composition for the smoker, but it is even more dangerous for others than it is for the smoker. Smoking also helps global warming occur, because the smoke composition can affect the greenhouse gases that warm the earth's temperature. As shown on the cigarette packs, cigarettes cause dangerous diseases that are even deadly. In relation to the issues with restaurants, smoke will disturb the other people who are in the restaurant, and those people will breathe in the passive smoke, which can cause asthma. If the other people are not smokers, they might cough badly and lose their appetite, so they will not eat happily, and it will reduce the restaurant's ratings because of the smoker. And how about banning smoking at all restaurants? It will not be fair if smoking is completely banned, so they should create different areas that divide the smoking and non-smoking customers.﻿The government should ban smoking in restaurants because smoking has many side-effects. Smoking is dangerous. The tool of smoking is the cigarette, and cigarettes contain many dangerous substances, addictive substances such as nicotine, which can damage our body system. For the active smoker, it also causes many problem to our health. They are problems with pregnancy and the fetus (for the woman), lung cancer, impotence, and many other problems. Going out from the effect of smoking, smoking in restaurants (and public areas) will disturb many people who don't smoke, who we call “passive smokers.” It is very impolite to smoke around those people, because sometimes there are people who dislike smoking very much. Those people will feel uncomfortable if there is a person smoking beside them. And it also causes the passive smoke to get the side-effects of smoking, so that problem has to be reduced. Moreover, many restaurants have air conditioners (AC) in their rooms. If there is smoke from cigarettes in the AC, it will damage the operation of AC because it needs a clean condition without any dust or smoke. That is why in many rooms with AC, smokers cannot smoke in there. So, it is important for the government to ban smoking in restaurants. And it has to be obeyed by all smokers.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because restaurants are places for visitors to eat and drink. Restaurants are not the correct place to smoke. Some people smoke after they finish eating, but how about other people? Do they like to do it? I think they feel uncomfortable about that situation. If that situation happens, the government must look for solution to this problem. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It is the solution for people who don't like smoking. As we know, visitors of all ages, from young to old, go to restaurants. Smokers must know about that, but they make the restaurant dirty. So, restaurants must give a special place for smokers, if they want to smoke. It is a better solution for the smokers and for the visitors who don't like smoking in restaurants. If the smoker fails to obey that regulation, the restaurant can give them a punishment. Maybe that smoker will have to clean the plates and glasses, or clean the restaurant floor. I hope that the solution can make smokers give up so they will not do it again, and they will keep a clean condition at that restaurant. I hope that the solution can be done at all restaurants and in other countries besides Indonesia so that visitors can feel comfortable and not worry about cigarette smoke in restaurants.﻿The question whether the government should ban smoking in restaurants or not is a big issue. In the perfect situation, smoking policies would be managed by the restaurant owners so that customers would visit the establishment which has the policy they prefer. Customers could decide if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers and non-smokers, before the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do. In my opinion, many smokers do not smell the smoke of others when they are in public places. Many years ago, people were allowed to smoke everywhere. As a result, an entire generation of elderly experienced lung, throat, mouth, and stomach cancers that were never experienced in history before cigarettes became popular. But now, I believe that each individual has the right to make choices which affect only them. So, I choose to visit restaurants that are smoke-free because there are many disadvantages of smoking. A restaurant with smokers is not a healthy environment for people who are having their lunch or dinner. The smokers take away the rights of other people to have access to clean air.﻿I agree with the statement because many people in Indonesia smoke, even though in reality, smoking is bad for the human body. I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Indonesia because restaurants are places for eating and it isn't delicious if other people are smoking in the same area. Passive smoking is very dangerous because it can cause cancer, so I agree with the above statement. However, the government must be careful with restaurants and smoking areas because people in Indonesia could become sick. And the price of cigarettes must be increased because it could reduce the number of smokers in Indonesia. Smoking does not have many positives for people and the country. A country without smokers can be a beautiful country because there is no pollution and the people can be healthy. I want Indonesia to be free from pollution because in Indonesia there is a lot of pollution, for example, from motorcycles, cars, and cigarette smoke. However, smoking should be not banned at all restaurants, but in all places that have many children there because children are growing. So, the children must be kept away from smoking areas. I would love a country free of pollution.﻿Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is a really good rule. Smoking has caused the loss of many human lives, not only for active smokers but also for passive smokers. It can damage smokers and other people. Smoking can disturb the health, body, and the comfort of people around us. The fumes of cigarettes can affect the lungs and respiratory system in the body. If there are many people using cigarettes in general places, it contributes to the bad things such as air pollution and dirty situation. For example, restaurants should be clean places and free from smoke because they are used for people to eat their meals comfortably. Restaurants are a place where many people want to rest and refresh the body by filling up the stomach with some food to get power for their activities, so it is not too good if they eat surrounded by smoke, which can decrease the quality of their food. People want to go to a restaurant to enjoy the food. So, it is a good rule that smoking should be banned in the restaurants to give a good service to the customers.﻿Now smoking has become a big problem to be solve worldwide. The majority of people like this activity even though it is a bad habit. Smoking has a bad effect on smokers and passive smokers. We don't realize when we smoke that the smoke is very dangerous to other people because the smoke contains dangerous chemicals that are bad for our health. Although it is a long-term effect, the government should ban it. Nowadays, all smokers are smoking everywhere, even in restaurants. We know that restaurants are the place for enjoying a meal or drink. It is not a place for smoking. It can disturb other people when they are enjoying a meal and enjoying a drink after smoking a cigarette. The people will leave rubbish from their cigarette. Let's imagine that many active smokers smoke in the restaurant, how many people will suffer from a disease. Although it's just a small area, it can bring many risks to our health, environment, and economy. The restaurants usually have a smoking area, so hopefully all customers can smoke in that room. In reality, it is useless because people lack awareness. The conclusion is that the government should ban smoking in restaurants, because it will affect not only society but also people's level of comfort.﻿Smoking is a disturbing action to people because smoking is dangerous for our health. People who breathe smoke from smokers are called passive smokers. Although they don't smoke, they get the effect of smoking from a smoker. This is bad for people that often do activities near active smokers. Active smokers usually don't care that their habit is smoking. Actually, they don't want to disturb people around them with smoking, but it has already become habit to smoke at any time. I hope that active smokers can stop their habit of smoking freely without caring about other people around them in order not to disturb other people. I think all restaurants in the country should suggest to people who visit there not to smoke in the restaurant. Restaurants can put up a warning sign saying not to smoke because it can disturb other people. Smoke from cigarettes can make the restaurant environment very bad and can cause health disturbances, including cancer. So, people must be careful when doing activities near smokers. Restaurants can prepare a special room for smokers to smoke so not to disturb other people, and they can smoke freely there without a warning from other people.﻿Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In the past, smoking in public zones had not yet become a big issue. But now this topic has become a big issue related to human rights. People believe that smoking in public zones such as restaurants can cause nonsmokers to become passive smokers. They believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many reasons are considered for banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country and public zones in general. The first reason is human rights. People believe that smoking in public zones is a human rights problem. Smoking in public zones can make nonsmokers become passive smokers, which is very dangerous for their health. There are facts that passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking. So, people believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and other public zones in the country. The other reason is health problem. As explained before, passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking because dangerous materials, which are inhaled by passive smokers are complex. So that passive smokers get more health risks. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. In conclusion, for several reasons, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants and other public zones in the country. The government should make a law related to the problem.﻿I agree with this opinion because smoking in restaurants can interfere with other people who are eating and make them lose their appetite because of the cigarette smoke, which interferes in the process of eating. Besides that, cigarette smoke also makes others breathe in secondhand smoke which contains chemicals that can damage human health. Secondhand smoke is more dangerous than cigarette smoke breathed in by active smokers. The concentration of nicotine for passive smokers is greater because the poison is sucked through the cigarette smoke of active smokers, which is not filtered. So that makes the passive smokers die of chemical substances that exist in cigarette smoke, which have been inhaled by humans and cannot be processed in the body. Cigarette smoke can cause heart disease, stroke, and so forth. Therefore, we recommend that active smokers reduce their smoking because cigarettes are very harmful for passive smokers who get affected by the cigarette. Smokers should become aware of how their actions harm others. It is better to fine every person who smokes in restaurants because it can interfere with every visitor who was eating at that place.",
    "﻿Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I think that there are many ways to answer that question. A part-time job can be done in part of your time. So college students can do a part-time job when they have spare time (if they want). There are many reasons why college students might do a part-time job. The first is that they need more money to have fun and pay the studying costs, and the second is that they need to get work experience for the future. College students might need more money because, sometimes, the college student's money from their parents is not enough. So, they will search for a part-time job. Why a part-time job? Because their study time can't be compromised with a regular job, and they will need a part-time job that has unusual work times, so they can combine their studying with working at a part-time job. After college students graduate from university, it is difficult to search for a job because the company that needs workers will ask for job experiences related to the new job. Therefore, if they do not have any experience, it will be difficult to find a job. Therefore, work experience from a part-time job will be very helpful. I prefer to agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job. It will give you experiences for the future after graduation, except if you do not plan to work in the future.﻿It is important for college students to have a part-time job because it has many advantages for the students. It will make the students become independent people. The students will get income from the salary of their job to pay their living costs. They will not have to bother their parents or spend so much of their parents' money. Moreover, the students will become disciplined because they will learn how to manage their time well; they will know when they have to study and when they have to work. In a part-time job, the workers cannot arrive late, so it forces the students as workers to be on time in their job. Not only that, a part-time job can also develop the student's knowledge. So, after getting lessons from college, the students can apply their knowledge directly in their job. Furthermore, the students can use their time well, so they can avoid wasting time having fun and shopping, and they will only use their time for useful activities. Therefore, as having a part-time job is very useful and important for college students, all students in the college should spend their time working at a part-time job.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As we know, the cost of college is expensive for students. It's easy if the parents of that student are rich. But, how about for students with poor parents? A part-time job is a solution for this situation. The student can help the parents avoid spending too much money, and the students will have new experiences beside their daily activity of studying. The students must learn how to split their time between studying and having a part-time job. They can also be proud to get their money by themselves instead of asking for money from their parents. In my opinion, they are independent students. If all college students had to do a part-time job, I think parents wouldn't have financial problems. And for those students, it can be a good start for when they work at a company after graduating from that college. We could say that they are training to get a new skill for a job, so it's a positive thing for the student. In this era, if we can, why not? We can learn from college students who have a part-time job. They get money by themselves, so they can help their parents. And I think they make their parents proud by what they are doing.﻿I don't agree that college students should have a part-time job for several reasons. The first reason is that it can break the focus of students' studying. The second reason is that it is so difficult to balance studying and working. Consequently, one of them will become a victim. Because when students have problem, it will affect the other one. If the reason of students working is to get experience, surely there must be consideration before that because working and learning are difficult to put together. As a college student, I don't agree that college students should have a part-time job. Especially if the students cannot manage their time well, because it only break the focus of their studying. Moreover, it is difficult to balance studying and working. Consequently, one of their choices will become a victim. So, the students cannot study as well as usual. When they have a problem, of course it will affect the other one. Even though they work to get experience, surely there must be consideration before that because working and learning are difficult to put together.﻿I was lucky enough that my parents paid for my whole college education. But I agree with that statement because by having a part-time job, we can help our parents, and we can earn money to buy everything we want. Besides, by doing a part-time job, we can get many experiences that may be useful in the future because experience is most important for getting a job. Moreover, we will appreciate the money more because we know how difficult it is to get money. However, we must manage our time for studying and doing the part-time job, so we have to have care about our time. Everybody knows that time is money. Managing our time is important if we do not want to lose something. So, having a part-time job is important for college students because we can get many advantages from it. If we believe we can do it, then why not? But, we have to remember that studying is our priority; therefore, even though we have a part-time job, we cannot be lazy about studying because we can get experience, and we can get used to living in society besides as a student. We have to be smart to manage our time so we can take advantage of it. Talk more, do more, and get more.﻿It is a true statement. College students usually choose a part-time job such as a private teacher, shopkeeper, or seller. They do this job when they aren't doing anything after they have studied at university. It has many benefits for them. A part-time job can provide many useful experiences and knowledge, and more importantly, money. College students need some money to live their life without asking for money from their parents. They must begin to develop their independence to provide their necessities by themselves. As we know, students have many necessities to pay for during their studying; they have to buy something that they need in their day, such as food. They can show their families that they can do things by themselves and actively training themselves to fit into society in the future and be useful for those around them. Therefore, at a part-time job, they can show their skills that they get from their studies at university or other skills they have. It can make a creative contribution to our government. Finally, it's very beneficial for college students to have a part-time job to make them active and to get some money to fill their life.﻿College is the highest place to receive a formal education. Because college students are required to study in college, they should not have a part-time job so they can graduate with a better grade. If they have a part-time job, they will not focus on their lectures, but every semester, students at university have many lectures worth about 24 credit points, which is about 11 lectures. It will disturb the students learning if they have a part-time job because a part-time job will disturb the student's mind and stop them from focusing on their lectures. They will not have much time to do their assignments. We know that lectures start in the morning and finish in the afternoon. I believe the students will feel tired because they get many lectures from Monday until Friday. Of course, the lecturer will guess the students' assignments. The students that have part-time jobs will not know about problems in their college. The function of a student is as a stick holder of our beloved country. If the students did not know the problems in their college or know how to solve them, I cannot imagine what our beloved country or our colleges will be like in the future. I think college students should not have a part-time job because they will not focus on their lectures, they will do not many assignments, and they will not know about the problems in their college.﻿A part-time job can be an alternative way for college students to earn money. Students who have a part-time job are independent students because they aren't only studying their lessons in college but they are also working to get a salary. They can spend their free time at a part-time job so they can pay their finances in college. They want to earn their money without hoping for money from their parents. It is important for college students because I think college students can be independent people before they graduate from college. By having a part-time job, college students can get new experiences outside of college. They will use those experiences after graduating from college to do a better job than other people. They hope after graduating that they won't be awkward in the working environment because they already gained work experience before graduating. I really believe that college students who have a part-time job will be successful because they can use their time for studying and working hard. They have already learned how to earn a salary for themselves without depending on their parents for money. They can manage their life without have to get money from their parents. Many companies look for people who have experience of a part-time job because they are not awkward when they work at the company, and they can do the job very well. In this globalized world, all college students need to use their skills, not only hard skills from their college but also soft skills from their experience outside of college.﻿Nowadays, many college students have a part-time job beside their main activity in college. A part-time job takes up half of the time in the day. College students usually do their job in their free time when they don't have any study activities. Many jobs are available in various fields such as a home teacher, shop keeper, working in a restaurant or hotel, or as an entrepreneur. Having a part-time job has many advantages for college students. College students can get a salary that can be used for many daily needs. They not only get money from their parents, but they can also buy things by themselves. For example, they can buy books that they need and pay for their school fees and other daily needs. Other advantages for college students who have a part-time job is that they can get experience. With a part-time job, college students can learn about real life, which is very important for college students. Many college students only know the theory of their study but they don't know how to apply it in the field. Indeed, many graduates are unemployed because they only know the theory of their study and they don't know the practical application of the theory. In conclusion, having a part-time job is very important for college students. They can get money by themselves, not only from their parents. Experience is another advantage of having a part-time job for college students. However, college students must manage their time between work and study.﻿I think working part time is very important for students because they can divide their time between study and work. Unlike many students who work while in college, some students work part time if they are fond of the job. By working part time, students learn to work together within the office, thus educating them to become good workers, because of course it is very different from studying. Working a part-time job that is in accordance with our interests will be more enjoyable. And most importantly, after college, we will certainly not become unemployed again because we can work. And even if we have to get a new job, we are more adaptable because we are familiar with working. When they work part time, students also get a salary from the job, so that educates students to become independent and not to bother their parents. To be able to share time between study and work, the student must get rid of their laziness to perform their work and learn how to discipline themselves so they can divide their time between work and study and work so that all jobs run smoothly, without any obstacles; that makes a worker perform the job well."

    "﻿Part-time jobs are important for college students. This statement is made based on my own reasoning. First, having a part-time job will be useful for us in the future. We can learn such skills as how to earn our own money and how to manage our income, so the time we spend working will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part-time job could reduce our family’s financial problems, even if just a little. Second, we must admit that sometimes the money our parents transfer to us monthly is not sufficient for our daily needs. Earning money by ourselves will be very helpful, so we will not burden our parents by asking for more money. They also cannot complain about how we are going to use it because as it is the money we earn ourselves, we have the right to manage it ourselves. Last but not least, part-time work helps us become independent. It gives us experience in handling the problems we will face in our full-time jobs in the future, and helps us learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, and how to handle the problems that we encounter with them. It is also easier to find a job if we have experience working for other people. For example, if we ever had a job and wanted to find a new job, our chance of being hired will be higher than for those who never had a job at all. Therefore, I conclude that having a part-time job is important for college students.﻿I agree that college students should have part-time jobs because the expenses of college or higher education have grown at an alarming rate over the past few years. This has compelled many college students to look for part-time jobs, which involves working for a few hours and attending college lectures once the work is over. Though there are some negative aspects of part-time jobs for college students like overexertion and some sort of tensions, these jobs provide students with much-needed experience that comes handy when studying courses such as management, engineering, and accounting. The following are some exciting part-time entry-level jobs for college students: A part-time job can help pay your living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. As you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as little as possible. Also, working part-time during college builds character. Most jobs available for college students are humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, janitor, or sales clerk, you will become much more grateful for the opportunities that college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on you hand and foot, and that if you want something, you have to give something first.﻿When teenagers were high school students, they had less responsibility and less self-dependency and were still living in their comfort zones. Therefore, as soon as they enter college, they step into adulthood as well. As adults, they have to be independent, able to take care of themselves, and take greater responsibility for their lives. This is why college students must have part-time jobs. There are three reasons why they should have a part-time job: to learn not to be dependent on their parents, to be able to work, and to learn adult responsibilities. First, by taking a part-time job, high school students who have just entered college can be independent and learn to not lean on their parents anymore since they will part from them later on. Second, by taking part-time jobs, they can learn about working and earning money. Although part-time jobs are small, they can give them a picture of how the working world is and how they can make a living through it so that later, when they are working in a company or starting their own business, they already know how to adapt and what to do. Lastly, through part-time jobs, they can learn how to be responsible for themselves by doing their work properly, and to those involved in the part-time job, such as customers, managers, and co-workers. This is why college students must take part-time jobs.",
    "﻿Smoking is never a good thing for many people, especially in public places such as restaurants. First, the smell of cigarettes fills the air and mixes with the smell of food. People will lose their appetite if their food smells like cigarettes or if they cannot smell their meal because of cigarette smoke. Moreover, some smokers do not have any respect for other customers; they blow smoke right from their mouths into others’ faces or throw ashes on the floor or their plates. Second, many people avoid restaurants filled with smokers, especially if they have their children with them. It is uncomfortable to eat while worrying about their children's health since it is easier for children to suffer the effects of secondhand smoke. The first two factors could affect the income of restaurants and cause a great deal of loss. Finally, there are many people in a restaurant who will inhale secondhand smoke, which is dangerous because secondhand smokers can contract lung cancer and many other infections much more easily than smokers themselves. Moreover, these victims include not only guests but workers and passersby. Overall, smoking should be forbidden in restaurants and smokers should be seated in an isolated room.﻿In my opinion, I (a non-smoker) agree that smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants, as it not only has harmful effects on the non-smokers present but also may cause allergic coughing in many people. In addition, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it, which may later develop into a habit. Cigarette smoke is more hazardous to passive smokers nearby who inhale the active smoker’s smoke because second-hand smoke is unfiltered, causing more adverse effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma, and carcinoma of the lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. Even if cigarette bans restrict freedom, especially for smokers, this step will go a long way to inculcating a healthier lifestyle. Many smokers who have gradually become aware of the ill effects of smoking are turning to de-addiction centers to break their habit. Even advocates of smoking in public areas disapprove of the practice when their offspring are exposed to it. Witnessing their elders’ smoking kindles a similar desire in youngsters, thereby giving birth to a new generation of smokers. To avoid these evils of smoking and ensure a healthy way of life for youth, it is not only our duty but also a necessity of life today to condemn such practices, if not legally then at least socially.﻿According to www.inforesearchlab.com, around 5.4 million deaths per year worldwide are caused by tobacco use, while www.cdc.gov reports that almost 90% of all deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease are caused by smoking, which is rated as the number one cause of death in the United States. Even without looking at these figures, we can see that people around us keep smoking despite the danger and diseases it causes. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all countries worldwide. There are three reasons for this. First, smoking is the source of almost all cancer diseases, starting from the most common cancers caused by smoking, lung cancer and cancer of the esophagus, to many other cancers, such as kidney cancer and stomach cancer. Second, besides causing many diseases in its users, some fatal, smoking also has a dangerous effect on secondhand smokers, and in particular, secondhand smoke or passive smoke has even more dangerous effects for people like children and non-smokers, increasing their chances of developing cancer. Lastly, smoking also has an environmental impact on the earth and one’s surroundings. Cigarette butts that are discarded on the ground and are not picked up end up in rivers where fish eat them, smoke from cigarettes contributes to global warming, and smoking also pollutes the air around us. For this reason, in light of the dangerous effects of smoking, smoking should be banned for our own good."

    "﻿It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As everyone knows, lots of college students have part-time jobs. I'm no exception. I even have many part-time jobs at the same time, such as a tutor who teaches sociology, a cram school teacher, and I work in sales, so I really agree with having a part-time job in college life. There are some reasons to explain why we should have a part-time job. First, because lots of goods are more expensive than before and families give children less pocket money, college students have to look for part-time jobs to buy many things. In addition, I think that we know many people who have their own characteristics in society, including our friends. Finally, to enhance the social experience, practice my working attitude, and gain more jobs in the future, I can't avoid doing work. And this is the main reason that college students have to have part-time jobs. In sum, having a part-time job helps me to understand that I can't give up halfway through a hard task nowadays. Besides, a boss doesn't want someone who has no skills, like a coach potato, in the company. Without a doubt, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, most students have part-time jobs in order to pay for something, such as food and transportation. On the other hand, foreign books are very expensive. It costs about NT 1,000. So far, I have a part-time job. I think I have learned a lot from my part-time job. For instance, I have improved my communication skills and become more self-confident. In 2009, every country faced an economic recession, and many people lost their jobs. Maybe many families faced that difficult problem. To deal with the problem, students had to get a part-time job. The situation is very common in a global economic recession. If students get a part-time job, it can decrease parents' struggles. Everyone knows a high education is very expensive. Having a part-time job reduces the burden on parents and increases t students' experiences. Finally, I agree with having a part-time job in college. It is not only to earn money but also to learn a lot. We can make a lot of friends in different fields. Getting a part-time job has a lot advantages if you can manage your time. If you are good at time management, having a part-time job is a good choice in college.﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, because college students have to learn how to make money and spend money. People who do not work are unable to realize the significance of money and randomly spend money. Certainly, because some university students the Gary economic agent cannot but work earn the living expenses are also one of the reasons. But work may not surpass own elevating capacity, in order to avoid the schoolwork they could not bear, instead the gain does not equal the loss, like this lost the significance which worked. Although more than half of present university students go to work, not many can give their studies proper attention. While work may enable students to experience society earlier and lighten some of the burden on the parents, if people take work too seriously and they are unable to give enough attention to their studies, they may not be able to graduate, which will increase the expenses of their studies. It is therefore important that the student's work does not conflict with their study time. ﻿When it comes to the topic of a part-time job, we normally relate it to teenagers, especially university students, nowadays. However, this phenomenon has been widely questioned by most people today, who think that the reason a student goes to a university is to study and gain knowledge instead of working and earning money. Hence, is a part-time job really good for a student or does it have a bad impact on the student? The answer is that it has pros and cons; it is only based on personal opinion. For me, having a part-time job consists of more pros than cons. For example, students who go for a part-time job can not only earn extra income but also learn how to balance their work and studies. They begin to learn how to manage their money well and, of course, when they are exposed to working life, they will definitely learn extra knowledge that is not taught in school. For example, the way they communicate with their colleagues is totally different from the way they communicate with their friends. In addition, they also learn how to be more independent and responsible. No matter how, most students go for a part-time job mainly because of financial problems such as they may have difficulty paying their tuition fees and so on. Thus, one of the fastest ways to solve their problem will be to get a part-time job. However, most of them normally face the problem of not getting enough sleep and being absent from their classes due to his or her part-time job. As a result, their performance in school may be influenced. In conclusion, getting a part-time job can be a controversial topic as it may be beneficial for someone who is willing to learn but disadvantageous for someone who is weak at managing themselves.﻿I think this is very important because college students have to work in the future, so if they can get some experience from a part-time job, I believe it is good for them. In a job, you can meet many different people, such as your colleagues, customers, and boss, you will go through many things with them, and you can learn a lot of knowledge and interesting things. Sometimes you can meet bad people, who can cause you trouble, but you have to stay calm, not get angry, and try to communicate with them. In this process, you can strengthen your mind. In addition, you can get money from a part-time job, which can lower home expenses, so, I support college students doing a part-time job. As an example, I have a part-time job in Carrefour in the summer vacation and winter vacation. One of my colleagues comes from the south of Taiwan, he is very interesting and funny and helps me understand everything. In the work, we can meet very many customers, someone can't find something, but the thing is in front of them, some can ask stupid questions, which are not related to my work, but after the question I can get a \"thanks\", which makes me feel content.﻿College students have to study hard in school. Should students do part-time work? I think so because I think you can learn many things from working, and we can know how to get along other people. We also learn more skills in the community. It is a way to learn other things and we can know how to live in the world. We can also know how hard our parents worked for us. If you have a part-time job, you can learn how to perform duties and learn many things. We can lighten our parents' burden. Parents should feel happy we can do it for them. I think there are two types of part-time jobs. One is fixed work. The other is unfixed work. The unfixed work involves going everywhere to work. If you think have to work every day, you should find fixed part-time work, because if you are only a student, it might be difficult to find all the jobs because you have to study in school. So, I think finding a part-time is good for us. Do you agree?﻿I agree that students should have a part-time job. As a student, they are more comfortable in life, so the parents must demand that their child search for a part-time job, as this is independence. Firstly, students will understand that making a living is hard and learn to increase income and decrease expenditure. For example, standing for eight hours in hot weather to hand out flyers to passersby is very tiring. So they will not only save the money in the bank but barely draw any money from the bank because money is hard to earn. Secondly, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. At the beginning, they couldn't do well at all and often made mistakes. Gradually, they could do a very good job, and then they feel very excited when they receive a pay check for the first time. This encourages me to make up my mind to find another part-time job at every chance. Finally, students can learn how deal with the relationship between working and learning. If they can balance it well, they can think they are sure to get enough knowledge as well as work experience to prepare for future success.﻿I think during the period of university we should try to work part-time, but achievements are very important. So, we should do appropriate part-time jobs. The jobs should be based on our academic studies. When you find part-time work, it will affect your studies. Students should concentrate on their studies. After all, students' work is to study and graduate. Part-time work is very important, but it is not more important than studying. If it will not affect my academic performance, I think I will try to do a part-time job. It is good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. After-school work enhances a young person's social development. After-school work also teaches students how hard it is to earn money and helps develop thriftiness in the younger generation. Because they earn money, students can pay for their education and thus they will value their education even more. And, in return, their experience will make them understand better what they have learned in classes and books. Part-time work allows us to learn many things. But students should not spend too much time on part-time work. I believe that when we graduate from university, part-time work clearly pays a very small salary. But we learned some life experience before graduating. Part-time work is obviously good for some people. These experiences are important.﻿I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, as a freshman in society, I wanted to find a job recently. When I mail my resume or my work experience to employer, I never receive an answer. I try to find an explanation; it's maybe because I have less work experience than other people. Second, a part-time job can train students' personal time management; a lot of college students are used to being like superman, which means college students use half of 24 hours to sleep, play computer games, do night active, and so on. But they can't spend time resting, studying, or doing something good! Third, part-time jobs can earn more cash. College students have more and more opportunities to join a lot of parties or buy something we like; we need money to do this. More and more families can't offer much more money to their children now, so perhaps they think how to solve this question, and part-time jobs may be useful!! So I think part-time jobs can train college students to have more work experiences or be independent. So I agree it is important for college students have a part-time job.﻿I agree that students should get a part-time job. I think a part-time job has positive and negative effects. The advantage is that you can learn more about how to socialize with other people; this can help you to find jobs when you graduate. The disadvantage is that you may need more time to study, or your grades will be so bad that you could flunk out of school. A part-time job can have both positive and negative effects on a person. First of all, students will be able to earn more money in order to pay their tuition, their rent, or buy whatever their heart desires. Moreover, one can learn how to socialize with others, which is beneficial when looking for a job upon graduation. However, the time needed for one to study diminishes. This can cause one's grades to drop drastically, which may, in turn, cause one to fail. In conclusion, students should only get a part-time job if they are able to handle their studies as well. Students who have a part-time job enter the society earlier than those who haven't. While working part-time, students experience how the society functions and learn how to deal with issues maturely. Having a part-time job could give the students hands-on experience to test their skills and see whether they are interested in the field of work. Additionally, students working at an early age encounter the hardship of earning a living themselves; therefore, they treasure and view money differently. Students with a job could also help out their family's finances.",
    "﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only would it make the restaurants look nice, but it would also let everybody have a good meal time in the restaurant without and smoke. For example, I had a meal with my friends in a restaurant near our neighborhood. A lot of people spoke and yelled loudly and were even drinking too much. However, the most important thing was that some people who looked like evil men were smoking continuously. It smelled so disgusting that I felt a little dizzy. I was really unhappy, but I could do nothing to prevent it. All I could do was leave the restaurant. That's why I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Many people are dating, chatting, and studying in the restaurants. I think that smokers are bad for letting other people breathe their second-hand smoke. In addition, according to research, it is easier for people who breathe second-hand smoke to get a disease than smokers. Without our health, we can't enjoy the good things in life. To sum up, no smoking at all the restaurants in the country is a good way, and I hope it can apply to every place.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to hospital statistics, smoking is bad for children, the elderly, and adults. Smoking can harm our health, especially our lungs. If you smoke a lot, you can cough a lot. On the other hand, buying cigarettes is very expensive, as it includes a health tax. If you quit smoking, you can save a lot of money. On television, the ads to ban smoking are popular. Most celebrities on TV tell everybody the dangers of smoking. As for me, I hate people who are addicted to smoking, and I also hate the smell of smoke. Because my sister is a nurse, I learned a lot from her. She has taught me about the dangers of smoking. Smoking is very risky and harmful. I don't think anyone should smoke in public, especially in restaurants. That behavior should be banned strictly. People should respect others. In public, we should speak quietly and not smoke. I think the government should make a strict rule for restaurants to follow. If people smoke at a restaurant, they should get a fine. For everyone's health, banning smoking in public is very important. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Smoking is harmful to health; therefore, many countries forbid smoking in public places. Although when they are smoking, smokers are very comfortable, the second-hand smoke that reaches others is harmful, because the smoke contains carcinogenic chemical substances, which raises the probability of getting cancer to higher than that of the smoker. Therefore, in public places, these smokers are being unfair. If the smoker wants to smoke, they should select a place with good air circulation, so it will not hinder others. They will also enjoy smoking well and will not need to accept others' advice again. If restaurants establish a smoking area, this benefits the smoker and isolates the smoker from other people, so they cannot smell the tobacco from a distance; this is good for everybody. Actually smoking is not good to the body, and such law may cause the smoker to stop smoking; this is actually advantageous and is harmless for the body.﻿Nowadays, the number of smokers has increased dramatically whereby even small kids know how to smoke. If this situation continues without any remediation, the consequences will be unpredictable. Many of us know that smoking is a bad practice, but even with all the information that states the effects of smoking, why do some people still need to smoke? One of the common reasons that leads a person to smoke is that he or she wants to release stress. Some people believe that they will actually feel better and more relaxed after they have a cigarette. However, there are a lot of other methods that can be used to release stress such as listening to music and having a conversation with friends. Therefore, why do people still choose a foolish way to release stress since there are so many other alternative ways? Every year, our government spends billions of money to stop people from smoking, such as organizing smoking campaigns to educate the youngsters to avoid smoking. Our government even restricts the selling of cigarettes to all youngsters under the age of 18. However, is this really effective? No, the fact is we can still find lots of underage smokers. It seems that the efforts from the government to prevent people from smoking still need significant improvements. However, the most important thing is that the smokers have to start changing their thoughts about smoking and their behavior or else the efforts our government has made will still be useless. I believe education plays a role, but it should start with small children. As a result, the chance for that child to become a smoker in the future will be lower. In addition, another important factor that may affect whether a child becomes a smoker is the behavior of the parents; parents who are smokers increase the chance of the children in that particular family to become smokers too. In conclusion, there are no specific ways to control and stop people from smoking but there are some ways to prevent people from smoking. Make the earth better and give yourself a better life; say \"No\" to cigarettes and be against smoking starting from today.﻿We should completely ban smoking in the restaurants because smoking can hurt all people's health. Some people really don't like the smell of smoke, or even hate the smell of smoke. The restaurant is a place to eat, and I think no one likes to smell smoke when they are eating. Sometimes in the restaurant, there are children and babies with their mothers, the smoke is not good for them and can affect their health. The restaurant is a closed room, so the smoke can fill the restaurant. So if you have to smoke, you should go out of the restaurant, to lower the effect. According to figures, the number of people who has died from second-hand smoke is more than smokers, so smokers are just like killers, but they do not know that they are killing people. Although some restaurants have set smoking places, you can still smell the smoke even when seated outside of the smoking place, which can still affect people's health. I think if you really want to smoke, you can try another thing instead such as candy, or something you can put in your mouth that doesn't hurt yourself and other people. I think this is the best way to solve the problem if you want to smoke in a restaurant.﻿Smoking in the restaurant? Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think I agree. Smoking has to be banned in the all restaurants because smoking is harmful for all people. People are happy to eat food in a restaurant, but if one guy is smoking, I think many people are very unhappy. It is not very polite. I think it should be rule in the country. If we have a rule, we can let people know that smoking is wrong in restaurants. So I think it should be a rule in restaurants. I think it will reduce the very bad example for children. Public places are for everyone, but many people don't like the taste of smoke. Smoking is very bad especially for children and students. Smoking is a very bad example, so we can't learn this bad smoking habit. I also don't like to smoke because smoking makes our health bad. If you go to see a hospital, you should know to pay attention to our health every day. So people shouldn't smoke in public places, not only in restaurants. We should know this rule. It is to avoid harming other people.﻿I agree that smoking should be banned in public restaurants. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea, even though it takes away some of our freedom. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer, and smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. The ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So many nonsmokers are against smoking. Therefore, a government ban on smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and the environment, so many people, especially nonsmokers, agree with policy. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom, but I think this is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in a public restaurant. In fact, smokers still have the freedom to smoke. But I think smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in public restaurants and everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us. Smokers and nonsmokers thoughts are different, but they must communicate to achieve the goal of no smoking in public restaurants, to protect our health and the environment.﻿Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I would argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. However, even though people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smokers, they should be free to smoke elsewhere. Smoking not only spoils a particular person's health but it also affects his or her entire family. It's a curse. Today we are all sensible and we know what the disadvantages of smoking are, but we must stop this poison spreading in our society, country, and home. In short, people should not smoke in public spaces. If I went into a restaurant, and while I was waiting for my food to come, I smelled the smell of smoke, it would ruin my appetite. In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the nonsmokers present there but also may cause many people to cough. Besides, many youngsters who are fascinated by the act of smoking try to imitate it, which may later develop into a habit. All in all, smoking in public places is not good behavior. We should try to ban people from smoking in public places. To prohibit by law is obviously the best way.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two ways to instruct it. First, for personal health, I've heard a phrase \"Health is Wealth\", which means that people who have a healthy body and keep themselves well perhaps have a lot of money in their personal life! Smoking can encourage the body to become sick. When someone is smoking, it can harm his or her body a lot! Especially cancer. For example, when someone is smoking, that smoke will go through their mouth and throat and arrive at the heart. Day after day, the body can't restore its health; it's a big question in life! Second, for friends, neighborhood, classmates, or strangers around us, second-hand smoking is terrible, because it has a bad composition; it is worse than it is for a smoker. Most people don't like to make themselves do something they don't like. So for the reasons of personal health and second-hand smoking, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I know this ban may make smokers unhappy, because this ban stops smokers from smoking everywhere. I think they will still have a smoking habit in their life, but this ban is based on fairness for everybody, so when a smoker wants to smoke at a restaurant, they must think of other people's wishes.﻿I agree. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is unfair. Although smoking is not illegal, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and will avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer a financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment, I discovered someone smoking, so I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But the staff said that the smokers had the right to smoke there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry. Luckily there are laws to restrain smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer be polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should have been set up even earlier."

    "﻿Having a part-time job is important for college students. In my opinion, there are several benefits from the part-time job experience. First, without a doubt, college students spend a large amount of money on food, groceries, pleasure, and so on. Therefore, having a part-time job can not only release the economic pressure on the family but can also make students take responsibility for it. Second, many fourth-grade students, who are about to graduate, worry about their future jobs; therefore, having part-time jobs before graduation helps students collect social experiences and have the chance to come close to everyday work life. In this way, college students are more likely to find out their true interest in various fields of work, which may explain the reason why many students after graduation are not in the relevant fields they learned on campus. Additionally, part-time jobs offer another learning opportunity for students. Don't look down on any job; every job is filled with knowledge and values. Take servers for example, if students have jobs in restaurants, they should learn how to deal with many unexpected problems, including keeping a smile and patience while being blamed by the boss or customers. As time goes by, students will become more mature and good at solving problems wisely. Are you a college student? Do you have a part-time job? If not, why not find a part-time job right now!﻿In my opinion, it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job once their school grades or other conditions become steady. Why? First, college students are old enough to be financially dependent. They are no longer kids, and they have the responsibility to lessen the pressure on their parents. They have to understand how hard it is to work, so that they can save and never waste their money. Second, they will no longer be students in a few years, so they have to judge what kind of job will suit them through having part-time jobs. Take me as an example. As a male, I have to do the military responsibility first for one year, and then I have to work. I am very afraid now. Many of my classmates are worried about not being able to find a job, and I may face the same situation in one year's time. One of my classmates declined the chance to be a teacher in kindergarten, because she found herself having no interest in education. And some of my classmates felt sad and worried after job interviews, because they found they didn't have the skills or experiences that the bosses wanted. So I think it's good to test college students' abilities by having a part-time job.﻿I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job for two reasons. First, a part-time job can increase your experiences, and you could learn many things that aren't taught in class. For example, if you work in a restaurant, you could learn how to communicate with different people, and you could learn how to handle emergency situations. If you are a homeroom teacher, you could increase your patience and you will know it's not easy to be a good teacher, which may make you study harder in class. Also, you can meet different kinds of people in different jobs, and you could learn more from their experiences. Second, a part-time job can earn you money, so you can share the economic burden with your parents. Even if the money is not much, the feeling of earning money yourself is so good. Finally, I think college students should find part-time jobs. Maybe the job you do has no relation with what you study now, but it's a good way to try different things. It will make your college life more colorful, and it really has a lot benefits for your future career.﻿I think it is good if it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job. It is good to have some work experience while in school, as more work experience might help you have more chance than others to get the job you want after you leave school. This means, it may bring you more competitive advantage than others. You can also learn how to get along with people and understand the difficulty of earning money, and it may make you more mature. However, as we may spend almost all our lives seeking work and working hard for money, I don't think it is necessary for us to start it during our school life. People always want to be adults in their childhood and want to be students when they start working. There are many things we can do only in school. Unless there are economy problems, I don't think spending time at a part-time job is worthwhile. Moreover, for those who cannot manage their time well, it is possible to spend too much time and energy on a part-time job, which may cause students' school grades to drop. Thus, if there is no need to get a part-time job, I think students should enjoy their college life. Don't be too eager to step into your business life or you may regret it.﻿It is necessary for college students to have a part-time job. The major purpose of college is education, thus, the college must provide a safe environment and a peaceful learning place. Because of the safe environment at school, students are always protected from the ruthless social reality of work, so they cannot observe the differences between the workplace and the educational place. Students can gain skills which are important in the workplace, such as work attitude, and they can increase their patience in order to deal with problems. Additionally, they will understand how to find out the relation between the part-time job and the knowledge they learned in college. Most of all, a part-time job for college students can make them actively get friends and expand their viewpoints, so they will not set their target too small and narrow in the future. Of all the effects of a part-time job, I think the most important and deepest one is about work attitude and patience. Even if someone is smart or learned, he or she will easily be in trouble if he or she lacks one of the above. Frankly speaking, learning how to get along with people will always be important and more difficult than the learning of knowledge. We can compare the workplace with a new college that proffers the learning of human relations. From a part-time job, we can learn more skills about how to live well in the workplace.﻿I am a university student, and when I have free time, I go to my part-time job. The reason why I go to this part-time job is that I want to add to my experiences and earn more money for my daily life. Before I was a university student, some bosses may have thought I was too young to do some part-time jobs, so it was difficult to find a part-time job. The special experience in my part-time job was to teach children aged only five years' old. At first, I thought it was a difficult job, but when I realized how to face children, I was so happy that I could do this job, it gives me so many experiences and I love children more than before. A part-time job is a good way to kill time and make some new friends. Therefore, I suggest that all college students find a suitable job in their free time; however, they cannot forget their school studies. They must be careful not to be cheated because they want to make money, so they should find the healthiest way to find a happy part-time job to enrich their lives.﻿I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. I'm a college student and I have a part-time job because my family financial situation is not good. I have to make some money to pay my school expenses. Except for making money, I got something else from working part time. First, I learned how to deal with different problems, because I had to face different customers who had different requests. Second, the more work experience you have, the easier it is to get a job in the future. In my process of finding jobs, most bosses don't like to hire employees who have no experience. From my viewpoint, accumulating as much work experience as possible is good for you in the future. Different jobs can teach you something that is not taught at school. Even though there are so many advantages for having a part-time job, students shouldn't let the part-time job affect their school life. We should make the perfect balance between part-time jobs and school life. Giving consideration to these two things makes your college life colorful. After all, it's a good experience for you and you will learn many things form your job. A part-time job is important for me and for you, so we should find one and start a new life.﻿I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons why I think working part-time is a good idea. The first advantage that comes to mind is that students can earn their own money for their allowance. They are no longer a burden on their families. Some outstanding students can even become financially independent. Second, people who earn money by themselves tend not to spend money because they want to but because they need to. Since they earn every penny by themselves, they understand the value of money and learn to cherish it. Besides, in order to maintain a normal school performance, it is meaningful for college students to learn how to manage their time well. Time management is vital at all times. What's more, they may have trouble with their co-workers, employers, or customers. When dealing with problems, they understand the value of cooperation and identify their responsibilities. However, some people may still disagree with college students having part-time jobs because they think that students should focus on their academic work and having part-time jobs will not have a positive influence on students' school performances. Nevertheless, as I explained before, that is not always true. Although school performance is important, it isn't everything. Part-time jobs can teach students something that they can't learn in school. I think students who have part-time jobs acquire more benefits than those who don't.﻿Part-time jobs are important to college students. College students have many social activities, like clubs, parties, and some competitions. They want to make more friends and experience a different life, so they spend more. Because they spend more, they need some extra money in their pocket. So, some college students find part-time jobs such as a tutor. If the working hours are too long, sometimes those college students will delay their studies, but they are usually shortsighted. They think that earning money is much more important than studying well. They waste their time on part-time jobs and join too many activities. As a result, some people suspend their schooling to get more part-time jobs. When they grow older, they will regret their decision; it is like putting the cart before the horse. They give up their studies for a meager salary. That's really ridiculous. As far as I am concerned, maybe I would get a part-time job if I had much free time, like the summer or winter vacations, or if I can pass the course easily. The most important thing is to complete the course you are there to study. Then, after you graduate, you will find a better job.﻿After entering college, many people will do part-time jobs to earn money. Their main purpose is to increase their pocket money, and I was no exception. I did many part-time jobs; for example, as a cram school teacher, a waitress, a file manager, and giving away flyers. I even have experience of writing news releases, and in conducting investigations. The main purpose of working is to make money, but I take my part-time job seriously and contribute my enthusiasm. Even when giving away the flyers, I have an amiable mood and I smile to every passerby. When I face my employers, I have a modest and polite attitude. I always modestly learn and do my best, when I do not understand how to do something. Even though bad customers make it difficult for me, I am not discouraged. After all, this is only part of my work. These part-time job experiences let me know how difficult it is to work, and I will be more cautious about the use of my money, though I believe that I may not spend too much money with worry about the society.  After all, I have had many experiences that I cannot learn in school.",
    "﻿Smoking is a bad habit, but it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it also affects others' health; however, if we advocate no smoking in all restaurants in the country, what would the chain-smokers do? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, so it's hard to ask them to quit smoking in a short time. So, if all the restaurants ban smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen in the end? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking area or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking. The action doesn't encourage people to smoke; it just offers some room for smokers to relax temporarily. A chain-smoker will be unhappy if they cannot smoke, and who wants to see somebody with a long face when enjoying a meal at a restaurant? In conclusion, setting up smoking areas is better than banning smoking at all the restaurants, as it is a better policy that can bring reciprocal benefits for all the restaurants, customers, and smokers.﻿I am a smoker. One smokes for different reasons. Teenagers smoke for fun. Doctors may smoke to relieve the pressure of performing surgery. Soldiers smoke because their days are boring. However, smoking is bad for smokers and may be even worse for non-smokers. Nevertheless, there are ways to prevent banning smoking at restaurants, or it would be unfair for those smokers. The government can divide all the restaurants into two parts: one for smokers, the other for non-smokers. In this way, there is a solution to resolve the problem. If one day, the government puts it into practice, this may somehow become unreasonable. If one day smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, gradually we may start to regulate other places to ban smoking including schools and hospitals. But we have to know that smoking does have its value. Without smoking, this world can't work in a good situation. We should never eliminate anything at random without neglecting its result. Smoking may even be a remedy to cure patients. Some people may live on it to earn money. This could not be banned completely, because it is a habit, and it can even be a fashion among many great people.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And the rule should be done strictly. Why? First, cigarettes are harmful to our body. According to reports, smokers have higher chance of getting cancer and other diseases. And the people who do not smoke but breathe second-hand smoke also have a higher chance of damaging their lungs. As most restaurants are indoors, the air is closed in and not fresh. And if somebody is smoking, all the people in the restaurant will smell it. In my experience, I hate the smell of smoke, every time I smell the smoky air in a restaurant, I have a bad feeling, and I don't want to eat anymore because the food is also not clean. So I think it's better to have a law not to smoke in restaurants. Some restaurants are divided into two parts, smoking and non-smoking areas. But I think it's not a good idea, because we can still smell the bad air. So, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I definitely agree with banning smoking at all restaurants. In fact, although it is hard to achieve, I hope that smoking can be completely banned at all public spaces someday. Although some people think smoking makes them feel comfortable and relaxed, the truth is, cigarettes do hardly anything but harm our health. And most importantly, people should have the right to refuse breathing in second-hand smoke. Restaurants are public spaces; therefore, people who want to smoke should consider others who might not be pleased to dine in an atmosphere full of smoke. After all, if the whole restaurant is full of smoke, how can you enjoy the smell of the food and taste it in good mood? People who have the habit of smoking should know that not everyone can stand the smell of it; in fact, the smell of smoke is terrible for some people who do not smoke at all. Moreover, it is obvious that smoking or breathing in second-hand smoke harms our health. Thus, the next time you step into a restaurant, even if you don't care about your lungs, please respect the rights of others in the same restaurant who might not want to breathe in your second-hand smoke.﻿In the country, not everyone likes smoking. Due to this problem, a lot of restaurant managers set up a smoking corner in their restaurants. We know that smoking is harmful for our health, so why don't those managers ban smoking in their restaurants? First, I think that it is because smoking is a habit. Moreover, it is not illegal. If smoking were banned, it would cause a big problem. Second, the restaurant is an important social place where people chat with each other. If someone's habit is banned in the restaurant, he or she must be more passive when at the restaurant than before. Thus, it will damage business if managers directly ban smoking in their restaurants. Therefore, it is difficult for us to ban smoking in restaurants in the country. We can support smokers to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke, but we cannot just ban it. Of course, setting up a new smoking corner or upgrading it is the major cure for smoking. If it is useful to prevent harm from smoking, then we do not have to deal with this problem with a too severe heart.﻿Smoking is addictive, but I am rarely around people who smoke because I think smoking affects other people. I often read news reports about how many people in Taiwan suffer from illness or even death because of smoking, and the adverse effects of second-hand smoke are far more than people imagine, but the government has no way of establishing clear and effective laws and regulations. After all, this is a personal habit so a law cannot be implemented. So I think school education is important in letting people know that smoking is a bad habit. In addition to other personal health problems, smoking has very bad effects on the environment. When I see a smoker on the road, they do not take away their cigarette butts, but they readily throw them in the street. I think this is not very good. This habit causes an environmental mess and destroys the beauty of the road. So I hope people can think about whether smoking can be good for you. If the answer is no, then please stop this behavior, and persuade smokers around you to stop. Life without smoking is more beautiful.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is like a drug. It makes people become addicted. Most people know that smoking is bad for their health, but many people still don't stop smoking. Doctors always warn us that smoking causes cancer, heart problems, and lung disease. Another problem is that smoking creates smoke, and the smoke from the cigarettes pollutes the air. This smoke also causes a bad smell and make people feel uncomfortable. The smoke produces \"second-hand smoke\", which is the smoke breathed in by people near a smoker. It makes non-smokers feel bad and can cause the same illnesses that smokers suffer from. So second-hand smoking harms other people, as well as the smoker. It's time for all governments in the world to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. If you want to enjoy your delicious dinner, you don't want to smell smoke. Non-smoking restaurants will be a tendency when more and more people pay attention to their health. Thus, there is no reason why this \"drug\" should be legal. The governments should raise the wine and tobacco tax to lower the number of people buying cigarettes in order to achieve the goal of a non-smoking environment for all people.﻿I think it is a good regulation that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, there are pros and cons for smoking. However, only one advantage comes to mind. People who smoke will trigger a chemical reaction in their brain which makes them feel good, happy, and comfortable, but they will have to get more cigarettes to achieve the same level of happiness. Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulting from smoking is the damage to health. Smoking destroys people's lungs. Smokers can't breathe as well as non-smokers, so they can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life quality, too. Besides, smoking increases the risk of suffering from cancer. What's worse, smoking has a great impact on both the smokers themselves and the people around those smokers. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it not only influences others at that time but also people who come in the future. Because the furniture and walls may absorb the bad things coming from the cigarettes, and impact future customers. Thus, I think smoking ought to be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Smoking is harmful to everybody. Those who like to smoke harm their families, friends, and people surrounding them, because secondhand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, which cause lung cancer and heart disease. But those who like to smoke find it difficult to quit the bad habit. When they smoke in a public place, the people around them feel uncomfortable, as smoking affects their health. The government should completely ban smoking in all public places. Ninety percent of people support it, but smokers say that such a law would deprive them of their rights. It's a really difficult problem. Maybe smokers could think about quitting smoking; it would be salutary to themselves and their families or friends. I am not a smoker, and I think it is essential to completely ban smoking in public. The law prevents others from the harm caused by second-hand smoke. The amount of fumes others smell and breathe in from smokers is really annoying. Banning smoking in public places doesn't deprive smokers of their rights, but it protects other people's right. Smokers will still have the right to smoke in their private space, and non-smokers will be free from smoke in public places. Isn't it a wonderful law?﻿Nowadays, some people smoke as a method release stress, but I strongly oppose smoking for several reasons presented as follows. First of all, in terms of health, smoking is very bad for the body. In fact, research nowadays reports that cigarettes contain nicotine and tar, which is proved to be very harmful to human health. According to studies, smoking leads to a higher chance of suffering from lung cancer, laryngo-carcinoma, and oral cavity cancer and so on. What is more, it is not only smokers themselves but also nonsmokers that are harmed by cigarettes. That is, experts believe that secondhand smoke does much more damage to people. Besides, they say that a secondhand smoker smokes six cigarettes while a smoker is smoking only one cigarette. Therefore, stopping smoking is not simply for smokers themselves but also for others around them. Last but not least, smoking builds a negative appearance of a smoker. Most people don't like the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, many people believe that the action of smoking would make them obscene and disliked by others. As a result, we should try our best to prevent people from smoking."

    "﻿I think having part-time job experiences for students in their college life is important. In my opinion, first, most students don't have to leave their hometown and don't have to do everything by themselves before they become freshmen. When they become a freshman, students might have to leave their hometown to go to a good university and parents might tell them that they should deal with everything by themselves including living costs. So this is definitely a good chance to train them. Second, they can learn a lot of rules and professional knowledge about the job and methods for making friends by having part-time job experiences. It is useful for training them and making their world wider. Besides, friends who they meet in their part-time job might be important in their future. For instance, they might find their best friend, or even their soul mate, and friends or bosses that can give a hand in their future job when they meet some difficulties. When doing a part-time job, the life in university can be looked at as a little society, so before entering the real society, it can be a good chance for students to practice and find ways to make themselves more sophisticated. I think having a part-time job experiences might be useful and make it easier for students to find good jobs.﻿I don't agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job, unless they must. Taiwan's education is not similar to the U.S.; we don't have many choices from which to choose to experience in school. Only in college can we choose many ways to learn, even if your major is not in the department, you can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can study many things, and you can control what time you want to go to school, except for major classes. How many classes you have experienced? Except for major classes, you have much time to do what you want to do, you might want to rest instead of being in class all day or you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long do you stay in college? General students have 4 years in college in Taiwan; you spend one third of that time going to major classes and more than one third going to other classes, there is not much time left to do things you want to do in depth. Sometimes, you think money is most important for your life, but, in my opinion, learning is really the most important.﻿In today's modern society, more and more students are earning their allowances. Besides, many employers want to hire people who have work experience before entering their companies. Thus, work experience for students is important. As we can see in the colleges, most of the students have a part-time job when they study. They not only want to earn their living, but also accumulate work experience. This experience is important for writing their resumes. When they want to enter a company in the future, many employers look at the section on work experience in the resumes. The more experience you have, the easier it is to enter your favorite company. And that's the reason why college students want to have a part-time job while studying. Take me for example, now I'm a college student, and I'm seeking a part-time job for the summer vacation. In order to broaden my work experience, I have tried many kinds of tasks which are totally different, such as a receptionist at the World Trade Center and a telephone caller in a cram school. In my opinion, once I have done more jobs, I will have more chance to enter my favorite firm. To extend the work experience, it is important for a college student to have a part-time job. Moreover, once the experience accumulates, the employer is more likely to employee you in the future!﻿In order to be an independent adult, we have to work in our student life. We will get much money and experience, and we will learn how to live in the world. For example, I have had three part-time jobs in my school life. My first part-time job is as a guide. My work involves taking Japanese tourists around Taipei City. I love traveling, so I enjoy the part-time job. It's interesting to me. My second part-time job is a cram school teacher. I have to teach junior high school students geography. The work is more difficult than my first part-time job. I have to help them improve their geography test grades. If the students don't learn the subject, I will receive complaints from the students' parents and the other cram school teachers. I not only have to ensure high geography test grades, but I also have to edit the new geography textbook. It's not easy for me. My third part-time job was a sales clerk at KFC. The work was busy. I had to clean tables, introduce set meals, and fry the chicken. I hated the job, so I quit after 3 months. Although I had some bad experiences, it's still important to me. These experiences are important in my life.﻿Actually, students don't have a lot of time to waste. Before senior high, you must learn basic theory, so you only have 7 years to learn the pro-level knowledge and choose which job you might do for your whole life. If you don't study hard, you may lose the job you want. Everyone wants to do the job they want, so you can't avoid being compared with others, as many companies decide who they want based on who has the most pro-level knowledge. Some companies will decide based on your part-time work experience, but most part-time jobs aren't related to the job you want because the company doesn't let untrained people do complex jobs. Therefore, you might not benefit from your part-time experience when you look for a job. Part-time jobs are not a bad choice when you are a student, but you should control your time well. Don't let your part-time job take up a huge part of your life. You still have to take the time to concentrate on your studies. Studying should still be your priority. Time is money; if you control your time well, you will have a lot of good experiences to enrich your life. Knowledge is the most important power for students. It's an unchangeable rule.﻿I have tried to work since I graduated from senior high school, not only during vacation but also while I studied for my exams. There are no other reasons for working, except that I am poor. I have to earn my living by looking for a part-time job and doing well. Actually, my free time is almost all gone. When I leave school, I have to run to my office. I have tried telephoning at cram schools or standing on the street all afternoon to distribute DM. I have little time to join my friends' activities. I left the ball team because I could not handle it. Sometimes I hate that I have to work, but I also find new fun in my part-time job. I can practice my conversation skills while being a waitress, and I can be friends with many other students like me, and I learn many experiences that I can't learn in school. I have also found a way to balance both my school and my job. I can use my time well to do each thing. I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because not everyone can handle both in his college life, but if you have the ability, you can train yourself and gain achievement in different areas. It's useful for your future work.﻿I agree that is important for students to have a part-time job at college. In our country, children are protected by their parents until they are 18 or older. We don't have much time to experience the outside world. Going to college is the first time we have to deal everything ourselves, so I think it's a perfect time to make more friends and know how hard it is for our parents earn money. You can learn a lot of things from a part-time job; for example, if you are a clerk, you can learn how to use the cash register and how to talk to customers. From those experiences, you may know how to interact with other people in a polite way. Also, you can try to release some pressure off your parents by letting them know you can do those things, so they don't have to worry about you. Moreover, in college we have a lot of activities, so you always have to spend some money. If you want to save money, you must try to earn money, and the income must be more than the money you spend. Although it's important to have a part-time job, we must remember our main job is our school work. Learning how to schedule our time is another challenge. Having a part-time job can make students more independent and more responsible for their lives.﻿In my opinion, I think every college student should have a part-time job during their school life. While we are in school, people always say that school is just like a small society. But if we want to learn how to socialize with people or compromise with others, we should get a part-time job. It's the fastest way to know how society works. Although we may feel upset in some way, every challenge is a new opportunity to experience society, and it makes us stronger. In the future, when we graduate from college and get a full-time job in other places, we will discover that the frustrations we faced before are nothing at all because we know how to deal with them, and solve problems from experience. While searching for a part-time job, there is some important information for students to know. Students should focus on their schoolwork and concentrate on their major courses, without interruption from the job. A part-time job is just a lesson to prepare us to enter society, but we students can't mix them, or we may screw them both up. A job is a job, the school is the school, and we need to separate the part-time job from our schoolwork.﻿People argue about whether students should have a part-time job; some think it makes people learn something, like society skills and speaking skills, but others think that it compresses the time that students need to study. I started my part-time job after I graduated from junior high school; that was the first time I got money from a job. I was so happy that I spent it very quickly; I bought clothes and food. I felt very satisfied, but the more people have, the more unsatisfied the heart becomes. So I felt unhappy when I had spent all my money. My best friend, Cindy, works at a part-time job every day. Her life is work, work, and work. When we have a group report, she usually can't do it with us, but it is important to attend our class, so we became unhappy and told her that it's not right. If the thing she learned in college is just work, and she ignores her friends, studies, grades, and future, it's like putting the cart before the horse. Now we don't do reports with her anymore. It is no use crying over spilt milk even if she regrets it. Maybe a part-time job can make one more and more wise, but it can let one lose one's college life. I think college time is more precious than anything. If you haven't enjoyed the time at college, it's very unfortunate.﻿As college students, we are responsible for our lives. We have to work for an income ourselves. That is why we need a part-time job so much. We have classes and need to study most of the time. We could do a full-time job, but the problem of living costs still need to be solved. To solve this problem, finding a part-time job is a good way. Summer vacation is coming. It is a hot time that many people want to find part-time jobs, especially students, because we now have more free time to work. If we make good use of the summer vacation, we can have extra money to use from a part-time job. Part-time jobs have some advantages for us. First, we don't have to throw all of our time into it. For most jobs, you just need to choose some period that you can go to work. Second, you can learn more new things and skills, most importantly, and also the ordinary reason we want to get a part-time job, is that we can earn some money. However, finding a part-time job also has some bad parts. One is that the salary is very little. Sometimes the employer may take students as free workers. The pay isn't equal to the amount we work. The other is that there are plenty of illegal jobs nowadays. If we don't pay full attention and find jobs carefully, we may break the law. So finding a part-time job isn't an easy thing and we must be careful.",
    "﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for everyone. Every year, many people die of lung cancer because of smoking. Despite knowing the serious data, there are still thousands of people who smoke in Taiwan and around the world. Some people might say that they smoke because they feel upset or angry, but I think smoking to improve a negative mood will hurt the body more and will not make anyone happier. Moreover, smoking pollutes the environment and disturbs the environmental balance. Smoking in personal spaces might not influence other people, but it is unforgiveable to smoke in public spaces, as it is important to respect other people. Restaurants are places where people go to enjoy food and relax, younger and older people go too, so I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for everyone's health. Furthermore, I think smoking should disappear from the world to make people healthier, because health is a person's best treasure and has a big influence on all people, from young to old. It is lucky to be healthy and live in clean environment. To protect our country and Earth, the government should send or revise laws to keep people healthy and maintain a clean environment.﻿We know the behavior of smoking is very awful; it not only harms your lungs but is also dangerous for everybody around you. Because the drug harms the human body, smoking has to be banned everywhere, except when you are alone. Someone who is smoking will influence other people, when they are in public places. If a person is smoking next to you while you are enjoying delicious food, you will smell the smoke and feel uncomfortable. Even if the dish tastes good, you will just want to get away from the smoker and won't be able to enjoy your dish. Smoking in restaurants makes everyone unhappy and harms their lungs and yours. The smell easily gets on clothes, so people who are not smokers will be influenced by the bad smell, making others think they are smokers and thus giving a bad image. Not only does smoking harm your health but it also makes other people lose their human rights. If you do not care about your health, no one can stop you smoking, but other people have the right to say \"no\" to your behavior. In order to improve everyone's moods, health, and their human rights, smokers should be banned from smoking at restaurants and all public places.﻿Many people hate smoking and the smell of smoke, as do I, because it may cause health problems and other worse outcomes. If the majority of the public dislikes smoking, the government should ban it at all the restaurants in the country. Research has found that smoking causes health problems, such as cancer. As we know, people who smoke can badly affect their health. However, people who do not smoke may be affected by inhaling the smoke of those who smoke in public, and what's worse, the possibility of having cancer is much higher than for smokers. It is unfair to those who do not smoke. Besides, some people think that the smell of the smoke is pretty disgusting, some even vomit when they smell it. If there is no law to restrict smoking in public, more people might end up in hospital. Most importantly, when we eat at a restaurant, we hope to breathe clean air and enjoy a comfortable environment. If someone smokes in such a place, the smell is bad, and it may pollute the air, and what's worse, it may ruin the taste of the food and affect the consumer's mood. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants for the sake of the public's health and for a comfortable environment.﻿It goes without saying that smoking has a bad influence on our bodies. If we keep smoking for a long period, we may be addicted to it as a result of the substance in the cigarette named nicotine. It is possible that we will be too addicted to quit smoking by the time we realize that smoking is such a terrible thing, unless we have the great determination and willpower to overcome all the difficulties we may face while quitting smoking. Besides this, smoking will weaken our lungs and increase the probability of suffering from lung cancer. If we suffer from lung cancer, it will make not only ourselves uncomfortable but also our family unhappy and worried about us as well. The worst thing is that we may even die because of it. Moreover, when smoking, we produce a substance which is so-called \"second-hand smoke\". Second-hand smoke affects the people around the smokers, making their health become bad. They may also get the same disease and suffer the same consequences as smokers. To sum up, cigarette smoking is really bad for our health. As a consequence, we should never smoke, no matter what kind of conditions we are in. In addition, we should persuade our family members who are accustomed to smoking to stop doing it.﻿I think the government should set the rule to ban smoking at every restaurant in the country. First, smoke is not good for pregnant women. Second, not everyone likes the smell of smoke. Additionally, I think smoking is an unhealthy activity, and kids might learn to smoke if they see others smoking. The smoke also could turn the restaurant into unhealthy place, because of second-hand smoke. It's not a good thing for restaurants, because fewer consumers might go to the restaurant. Of course it's not an effective policy because, even if the government sets that rule, smokers could smoke outside the restaurant. But if it can lessen the number of smokers, I think it would be a good situation. It also can improve the restaurant's atmosphere. For smokers, it's a good chance to quit this unhealthy activity, as it causes lung disease. Much research proves that. But it's not effective for the smoker because they rely on smoking to reduce the pressure. The policy of banning smoking might reduce the amount of consumers at the restaurant because a lot of men want to smoke, even when they are eating dinner. It's an unchangeable but true situation. I think the government should set more rules like this not only in restaurants. They should try to make a non-smoking society. It's difficult but it could also put the country into a good situation because the power of the government is from the people. If people aren't healthy, it's not good for the country's development.\n﻿I strongly agree with the issue because I cannot endure people smoking. Sometimes I can understand why people smoke, so I don't blame them. But when I want to take a break, the smell makes me distracted. It is really not a good experience. Actually, smoking is not a good habit since it is not good for your health. More importantly, it affects not only you but also the people around you. It can hurt your breathing system and even result in lung cancer. Your teeth may be yellower and you can't give up this habit unless you make up your mind. You want one every time you finish your dinner, lunch, even breakfast. You especially like the feeling of smoking with your \"good friends\". You even like to go on smoking when your parents or wife (husband) do not want you to. Giving up smoking is a very long journey not only for you but also for your family. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. At least, restaurants should mark an area as \"no smoking\" for a clean eating condition. Smokers should be aware that not everybody likes the smell.﻿In the science museum, there is an exhibition of two lungs, one is a lung of a smoker, and the other is a healthy lung. You can see a lot difference between the two lungs; the smokers lung is black and broken. This tells us that smoking is not a good thing. Smokers make a choice to smoke, and other people have the power to say NO. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Every time we choose a restaurant to have a date, we go on the Internet to search for information, call the restaurant to make a booking, and finally it's time to go to the restaurant. You are eating and chatting for a while and then a person sits next to your table and starts smoking. What should you do? People like to do whatever they want, but sometimes these things harm you and others. For the health of your friends and other people, if you want to smoke you should go outside of the restaurant. Smoking should be banned because some smokers only think about themselves. There should be laws to tell them not to do so. For good health, the best way is not to touch cigarettes.﻿According to a recent study, second-hand smoke does more harm to nonsmokers than to smokers. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm not a smoker, and most of my friends refuse to breathe second-hand smoke in public places, such as at schools, department stores, and restaurants. Second-hand smoke causes air pollution and makes nonsmokers feel uncomfortable. The government should pay attention to this issue. Smoking not only harms the smokers but even does more harm to non-smokers. While smokers' bodies have adapted to the adverse effects of smoking, nonsmokers don't have this advantage. Restaurants are public places where everyone can visit. Smoking should be banned in the restaurant, so smokers need to obey the regulations and respect nonsmokers who don't want to breathe in the second-hand smoke. The most important thing is that our government should make laws about smoking in restaurants. Those people who smoke in the public places such as department stores, schools, and restaurants should be fined. A team should be established to catch smokers who smoke in public. It is the best way to protect nonsmokers from second-hand smoke.﻿Many people like smoking, but I think it's very bad behavior. It is easy to buy tobacco at convenience stores. Even though the staff will ask you to show your credentials, it hasn't reduced the amount of smokers. Smoking will make people unhealthier. A heavy smoker's probability of getting cancer is higher than non-smokers. It's harmful to our bodies. Even though the box of tobacco may print the pictures of people with cancer, heavy smokers don't care about it. The most important thing to them is the tobacco. I hate the smell of tobacco; it makes me short of breath, so I am grateful that no one smokes in my family. They don't harm themselves. My older brother told me when he was in army that someone tried luring him to smoke, but he refused, because he thinks health is the most important thing in the world, and the smell of tobacco is not good. I think smoking should be banned in public places, because not everyone can accept the uncomfortable smell. If every heavy smoker smoked in the public street, we would smell it in every corner, but it's harmful to our bodies.﻿There are many people smoking nowadays, most of them are males. People started smoking a long time ago. Though everyone knows that it isn't good to smoke, it can't be stopped. Cigarettes have some bad components, which are harmful to your health. According to reports, you have a very big chance of getting lung cancer if you smoke for a long part of your life. Even though we all know about the bad effects that smoking brings to us, why can't we stop smoking? Because there are some chemical components in the cigarette, which make people addicted to it. If the person doesn't smoke one day, he or she may feel uncomfortable and think that there might be something wrong. There is another reason why we can't stop smoking. There are a lot of companies who sell cigars and cigarettes around the world. If the authority made laws to stop selling their products, they may protest to the government. Many of these companies have a great effect on their country and economy, so stopping the sale of cigarettes could have a bad effect on the economy. In order to control the amount of smoking people, the government raises the price of these products, hoping people will stop buying them, but it doesn't work well at all."

    "﻿Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking harms our body and leads to lung cancer, makes our teeth look dirty, and smells bad. More seriously, smoking is not only harmful to ourselves but also to the people who surround us. Second-hand smoke causes those innocent people harm without having a choice. It is kind of unfair since you are the one who enjoys smoking and the nearby people will also be victims. Some would even say that \"you can leave to avoid the smoke, it's your choice.\" If you are having a superb dinner in a restaurant, with good company, great music, perfect wine, and with all your kids, it would make a lovely photo. However, if there is a guest who was smoking nearby, all you can smell is the stinky smoke and you lose your appetite. Your first thought is to leave immediately, but it's really a pity to leave all your gorgeous food there. And since you are not the one who does wrong, it's not your fault. The smokers are the ones who should be blamed! Therefore, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Everyone knows that smoking is not good for us. The smoke contains many kinds of chemical compounds which can cause cancer. If you don't smoke, you can still be threatened by smoke because people around you could be smokers! There is much medical evidence showing that the harmfulness of second-hand smoke is greater than that of first-hand smoke. When someone smokes around you, maybe you will walk to them and say \"Excuse me, sir. This is a non-smoking place.\" Usually this guy would throw away his cigarette and say sorry to you, but sometimes you are not so lucky. This man could say \"Why? Why don't you go away?\" At this time, the government should make a law to restrict the rights of the smoker and protect those non-smokers. The law should say that one cannot smoke at the place which has more than three people, including restaurants. If someone ignores the law, they should be fined ten thousand NTD. Based on the reason of health, smoking should be banned in public places such as restaurants. If we don't do this, we will suffer from health problems caused by smoke. Next time you eat dinner at a restaurant, no one should smoke beside you.﻿My answer is \"YES.\" Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that if someone smokes, some smell is produced from the cigarette, and the person's surroundings will smell bad. The bad smell certainly ruins the great meal and the mood. And the second reason is that smoking ruins people's health. Nowadays, more and more people die because of lung cancer. Some of them are addicted to smoking, but some of them are just breathing in too much second-hand smoke. Smoking not only makes people get cancer but also make the smokers' teeth become yellower day by day. That way, no matter how handsome he is or how pretty she is, when he or she smiles, their teeth will scare many people. The third reason is my personal opinion; I do not like to be with a guy who smokes in front of me. The bad smell really makes it difficult for me to breathe, and also makes all of my body, my hair, and my clothes smell bad! I think government should teach those who smoke to quit smoking, and the smokers should learn how bad their behavior is. So I completely agree that smoking should be banned at all of the restaurants.﻿Although some people think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country; I hold a different opinion on this issue. First, everybody knows that smoking is not only bad for those who smoke, but also for those who do not smoke. This is very unfair for those who do not smoke. They do not like the smell of smoke, but they still have to bear it and their health conditions are affected. The only way to protect those who do not smoke is by totally banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Second, more people's lives will be saved by doing so. My grandfather did not smoke at all, but he died of lung cancer because many of his friends smoked. If this law had come earlier, many people would not have died of lung cancer. Third, restaurants are places for people to have meals instead of smoking. Those who smoke should not come to restaurants to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should go to a smoking area. In conclusion, since a lot of surveys have already pointed out that smoking is bad for people's health, we should have strict laws to restrict this bad thing, or more people will die from second-hand smoke.﻿Smoking is extremely harmful to health. It is harmful to not only the smokers, but also the people around them. Because of this, smoking is banned at most of the restaurants in Taiwan now. I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants should have the right to decide what they do. They can welcome the customers who smoke, or they can put a ban on smoking. However, restaurants should have a sign on the door to let the customers know whether they can smoke there. If a person who doesn't smoke sees the sign that smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he would not go in and have a meal. Conversely, if a person doesn't care about the smell of smoke, even if smoking is permitted in a restaurant, he can still have a meal there. Besides, restaurants can be parted into smoking areas and nonsmoking areas. To sum up, the most important thing is that restaurants should mark clearly whether customers can smoke in the restaurant. Then customers can decide where they want to go. If a restaurant loses their customers by letting people smoke, they could afterward put a ban on smoking. Hence, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I disagree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Even though smoking is harmful to people who smoke, and also to people who don't smoke but are around, I think we should still respect the smokers' needs. To explain it in a simple way, people gain happiness through different ways. It just happens to be a harmful way for the smokers to gain happiness. It may urge them to quit smoking if the government practices the ban, but to those who haven't succeeded in quitting, it could be torture if they can't find a place where smoking is allowed except their homes, and it might cause further problems. There should be a substitute plan: Smoking should be banned at common restaurants, except for those with smoking areas set apart from non-smoking areas. Second, the number of restaurants with smoking areas should be limited. Third, any violation of the rules should be heavily-fined. The government should put more effort on educating people, preventing the non-smokers from starting to smoke, and providing help for the smokers to quit smoking before implementing such strict legislation. It is important for the government to think of a proper policy that makes both the smokers and non-smokers better off.﻿I disagree with the claim that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Instead, there should be a part of restaurants maintained for the smokers. The supporting reasons are as follows. First, smoking is a basic human right, even though it may be bad for the smoker's and others' health, we cannot forbid people to smoke. Therefore, restaurants that allow smoking should provide spaces for those who want to enjoy eating and smoking at the same time, and then these places can gather those who smoke together and leave those who cannot bear the smell of cigarettes in a comfortable place. Moreover, smoking is a special culture, and we should not wipe it out from the diverse society. Some restaurants provide water-smoke devices, and smokers gather together to share that habit, and tourists even come to visit that kind of restaurant. If the place of sharing a habit disappears, then the culture about the habit is hard to keep. Still, unlike drugs, of which only a little amount can lead to severe and immediate damage to the body and the loss of a working ability, cigarettes are not so dangerous; only a large amount of smoke cigarettes harm people's health. To sum up, smoking is more a right and a habit than a danger. Therefore, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿Many people believe that having a meal and cigarettes is part of our social life and doing business. However, while it is well known that smoking is bad for human's health, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, a second-hand smoke environment is worse than actually smoking cigarettes. A restaurant is a place for families, and people including kids and pregnant women, to have a nice meal. If you allow people to smoke during the meal, it's not only very rude to other guests having a meal with you but also harmful to other customers sitting in the same restaurant. Second, all those customers who don't smoke might stop coming to the restaurants, which would reduce the income of the restaurants and make them close down. The taste of food would be destroyed by smoking at the same moment as well. It is not a proper way to enjoy a nice lunch/dinner. Last but not least, smoking is not a requirement during the meal. Normally people want to smoke after the meal instead of during the eating process. If people want to have a more relaxing conversation by having a cigarette, they can also go outside or some other places such as a lounge bar. Smoking in a restaurant is not only impolite but also has a bad influence on other customers' health. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.﻿I, who doesn't smoke, completely agrees with that. In my opinion, smoking doesn't bring any benefits; it's a totally bad thing. Smokers shouldn't smoke in the restaurant. In restaurants, it's hard for them to have completely separated smoking and non-smoking sections. If one person smokes, then everyone around him has to breathe in the smoke. Also, the waitresses in a smoky bar or restaurant will breathe in entire boxes of cigarettes just from breathing the dirty air. For people who don't smoke, it's hard to stand it. Maybe people who smoke will think that it's nothing. But for people like me, who don't smoke, it is really stinky. Furthermore, when we breathe in the second-hand smoke they produce, we may have higher risk of getting cancer. Smoking is bad for our health. When people smoke, the smoke they produce also causes air pollution. Everyone wants to have a good environment when having meals. I think people shouldn't smoke when having meals. We should ban this in the country. Having meals is a pleasurable thing, but when people smoke during that time, I think most people won't feel good. It's really important to ban this in the restaurants. I totally agree with that.﻿Smoking is really a strange thing for me and confuses me a lot. Every time I stand at the bus stop waiting for the bus to come, walk on the streets, or even stand in front of a restaurant waiting for my meals, I can often smell some bad and disgusting smell which comes from some other people's smoke. \"Disgusting second-hand smoke again!\" I can't help but feel uncomfortable immediately owing to the smoke. \"How can people be fond of smoking and even have to smoke a lot every day?\" As far as I am concerned, smoking is no good for people. Not only does it harm your health and your lungs, but it also takes so much of your money to buy the cigarettes. You have to face the risk of getting lung cancer, spend a lot of money, and you are even hated by some other people. Then, why can't smokers stop smoking? I think some smokers can't quit because it makes them feel relaxed and they are even addicted in it. Therefore, it seems hard for those smokers to quit. And for some teenagers, they may think smoking is a cool thing and start to have the bad habit. However, I don't think people should keep smoking no matter what the reasons are. Smoking can not only harm your health but also harm the health of others. And it also makes the city more unclean because of the deserted cigarettes which are on the ground everywhere. Therefore, for everyone's health, the city's environment and saving money, I think smokers had better quit the bad habit as soon as they can.",
    "﻿I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job; first, college students should be responsible for their behaviors, and not rely on their parents all the time, even for daily life spending. They can earn a living by getting part-time jobs, so that they will know that earning money is not as easy as they thought. Once they have a part-time job, they will be more careful when spending money and be more responsible for their behaviors. Second, by doing a part-time job, they can make friends with people who have the same interests. For example, if you work as a sales assistant, you will meet someone who is outgoing and also loves to interact with other people; if you work in the kitchen of a restaurant, you will meet someone who is also interested in cooking or baking. So no matter what kind of job you get, you can always find someone who shares the same interests with you. Last but not least; through the job, students can learn something which they cannot learn in school, such as, how to interact with customers and what to do when they complain, and how to work perfectly with co-workers and the boss. They will also know which ability they are lacking, so they can learn even harder during their free time at school. For those three reasons, I totally agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job for several reasons. First, you can earn money on your own. When we are growing up, the entire bill for studying is paid by our parents. Usually one enters college at the age of eighteen. Eighteen years old means you are an adult, so you should share the economical load of your family. You can use the money to pay for your registration and learn to be independent. Second, you can learn how to deal with problems encountered in your work. When you solve these problems, you can get experiences that will one day help you when you graduate from school. Last, you can make friends from your work. A good friend will be of help in your future work, especially when you are in trouble. He can save you when you need help. But as a student, your primary goal is to get good grades to pass the exam, so you shouldn't spend too much time at your part-time job. You need time to study and to go to class. Try to distribute your time among your class, part-time job, hobbies, and the rest! Those things must be balanced or you will regret it in the future.﻿It depends on the person's needs. Different students have different needs. Rich students do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not, but for poor students, having a part-time job is very important. However, some students will have a part-time job in order to get work experience. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send much money for me as an allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to restaurants or go traveling, etc., I have to pay for myself. Students have part-time jobs not only to earn some money as an allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily life, and the other, a school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and I can earn 95 NT dollars per hour. Although, having a part-time job is quite important for some students. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided by my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different for different students. As long as you need one, then just go find one. But we should also remember to not only take on the responsibility of the job but also protect ourselves.﻿Although some people think that university students should concentrate on their studies and they should not get a part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many advantages for university students to get a part-time job. First, if they get a part-time job which is related to their major, they will understand more about their major and future job. Many high school students in Taiwan just choose their major based on their grades or according to their parents. Some people find that they dislike their job after they start working in the field. However, they already spent years completing their Bachelor's degree and it may be too late for them to study another major in the university. One of my friend's major is accounting. After she had an internship at Ernst and Young, she realized that she does not want to work for the Big Four for the rest of her life. Another advantage of having a part-time job is earning money and the local economy. There are many traditional opportunities for university students to be a private tutor. Students can earn money while children in Taiwan can have a better education. According to some surveys, teenagers are more likely to spend money than other people. As a result, if university students cannot have a part-time job, there will be a negative impact on the local economy. In conclusion, university students have the right to have part-time jobs. Since there are so many advantages for students in getting part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿Many college students have experiences of doing part-time jobs. Some of them even spend most of their leisure time doing part-time jobs. I think doing part-time jobs is really important for college students because they can learn what they can't get from school. For example, they broaden their fields of vision by having more chances to get along with different people. Second, they learn to have sense of responsibility by taking charge of their tasks. Third, they make friends with people from different places, which makes their college time more interesting and substantial. Nevertheless, college students can't have a part-time job if they cannot concentrate on their studies. Although I think that having the experiences of part-time jobs is important, learning from their studies is the most important thing for college students. If students spend most of their time doing a part-time job, they will miss the chance to enjoy campus life and make precious memories. To make matters worse, they may fail their examinations. To sum up, college students should first do their best in their studies, and they should participate in activities in school, like clubs. Experiences of clubs are useful for improving abilities of leadership, and are thus helpful for applying jobs after graduating. Only if they still have time should they have a part-time job while enjoying their college life.﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My answer might have been the opposite before I got two part-time jobs this summer. After working from 9 am to 7 pm in the place where I work now, I find several reasons why it is important for college students to work part-time. First, by working part-time we gain different kinds of work experiences before we graduate and work full-time. Full-time jobs mostly require professional knowledge and skills and they are more serious; thus, it is more difficult to change your job once you are in a full-time position. What part-timers are required to do is often less professional. When you are applying for a part-time job, there should be more choices so you gain different kinds of experiences from doing different kinds of jobs. This is precious because it might be a help to your future career; for example, you might learn some professional knowledge through the work, and through various kinds of work experiences, you might determine what you really want to do. Secondly, by earning money on our own, we are more likely to spend money in a more careful way. It is common for young people to spend money on unnecessary things, and part-time jobs are not usually high-paid jobs. Thus, by being paid based on our work hours, we realize how difficult it is to earn a living and thus build correct concepts of money. Still, there are some more benefits from working part-time, as it is a help to those students that face economic pressures. To sum up, I think as long as students are able to use their time well - that is, part-time jobs will not influence their studying - it would be beneficial to students to have a part-time job.﻿Having a part-time job is an important and necessary element for college students. As long as one can organize his/her schedule well and use the time efficiently, a part-time job is a helpful experience and good training for the future career. Several key benefits of a part-time job will be discussed in the following. First, from a part-time job, a college student can get real experiences related to his/her major, which helps one understand more and apply what he/she has learned. Alternatively, he/she can explore a variety of jobs and discover the most suitable future path for him/her. And then he/she can turn the focus to what he/she wants to study. Moreover, working outside of the school may lead to the chance of meeting various people, which can further broaden one's horizon and enrich one's knowledge. Besides, it is a good chance to practice how to deal with people and business, e.g., cultivating patience and toughness, or forming the habits of efficiency and punctuality, and this does well for one's survival in society and in a future career. Last but not least, a part-time job helps to reduce the financial burden or is a resource for earning more allowance. Compared to stealing or cheating for money, a legal part-time job is a safe way to gain money. All in all, a part-time job is helpful for a college student, and thus having experienced part-time jobs is important in college life.﻿I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job during their college period. The following are some reasons why I consider having a part-time job is beneficial. To begin with, going to a college is like preparing to establish your future career. Students learn and study knowledge for what might be useful one day. If you can have a part-time job while you are studying, you can learn more efficiently from not only the textbook but also the real life experiences. In addition, having a part-time job can help you to gain respect from peers and establish relationships with others. Take myself as an example; I was once working in the National Theater as a receptionist. I learned how important it is to communicate and listen to customers. I became more eloquent when talking to others for I needed to give specific orders to my peers to help them accomplish some tasks. In fact, participating in both school and work was pretty exhausting. The tight schedule nearly made me fall to pieces. However, following that tough period, I can embrace challenges instead of giving up whenever I am faced with difficulties. I became more patient with people, and I welcome any criticism. In conclusion, having a part-time job can help college students learn more efficiently, gain lots of experience, handle pressure well with patience, and welcome criticism. As a result, it is important for college students to have a part-time job.﻿Having a part-time job is a good thing for students. It can not only make students gain work experience but it can also make them more independent. But for me, having a part-time job isn't very important. Nowadays, more and more college students have part-time jobs. When the class ends, students usually say that they are going to work. They work so hard that they don't have time to relax. Because of the work, when friends ask them to go shopping, they always turn them down. If you are always absent, friends will not invite you next time and you will become lonely. Besides, many students who have jobs after class often finish late. When they get home, they don't have the energy to review their homework, which makes them get lower grades in the class. Furthermore, because they are out of energy, some of them even sleep during the class. It's not worth it if you get lonely and get bad grades just because of the work. Before you get a job, you should take care of your schoolwork. Students should behave as students. Thus, I don't think it is very important for college students to get part-time jobs.﻿A part-time job is an inevitable part in my college days. Since I started studying at university, I have taken many kinds of jobs from a waitress to a tutor. There are so many jobs I have done that sometimes I can't remember all of them. There are several reasons why I took so many part-time jobs and what part-time jobs mean for me. First, I have to earn my own living. Since my family doesn't have the ability to support all of my life expenses, I have to make some money to support my own life. Therefore, I took many jobs to earn enough money for my life. Second, I can have different experiences and learn some things from taking different jobs. Since I have done many kinds of jobs, I have learned different experiences from them. For example, I learned how to cope with the students I tutor and I have learned some teaching skills. I also learned how to treat customers in a suitable way when I was a waitress. These experiences are really meaningful for me. The last reason is that I can make different kinds of friends from different jobs, and it's really interesting to have some chats during work time. Part-time jobs take up a great part of my college life. Even though I feel tired or frustrated because of them, I believe that I have learned a lot and matured from these experiences. Therefore, I really can't imagine what my college life would be like if I hadn't done a part time job. "
